  "body": " Intermediate Algebra is a textbook for students who have some acquaintance with the basic notions of variables and equations, negative numbers, and graphs, although we provide a \"Toolkit\" to help the reader refresh any skills that may have gotten a little rusty. In this book we journey farther into the subject, to explore a greater variety of topics including graphs and modeling, curve-fitting, variation, exponentials and logarithms, and the conic sections. We use technology to handle data and give some instructions for using a graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility.  We discuss functions and their applications, but not in the detail expected of a precalculus course; our intended audience includes students preparing for the many fields that may not use calculus but nonetheless require facility with quantitative reasoning. We aim to develop that facility in the context of modeling and problem solving.   Each section of the text includes Examples followed by a similar Practice Exercise that students can try for themselves in WeBWorK.  There are also \"QuickCheck\" exercises, usually multiple choice or fill in the blanks, for students to check their understanding of the concepts presented.  Homework problems come in three groups: a short Skills Warm Up that reviews prerequisite skills for the section, then Skills Practice with new skills, and finally Applications.  We have included a variety of applied problems that we hope students (and their teachers) will find interesting.  In addition, each Chapter begins with an Investigation that can be used as a group project or as a guided in-class activity.  Chapter Reviews include a Glossary and a Summary of key concepts as well as Review Problems. There is an Activity booklet available that provides an interactive lesson for each section of the text. The Activities can be completed by students in groups or with guidance from the instructor; or they can be used as support for a lecture format.  Katherine Yoshiwara  Atascadero, CA 2020  "

  "title": "Creating a Linear Model",
  "body": "Creating a Linear Model linear model   To help them understand phenomena that affect our planet, scientists study the connections between relevant variables, such as sea level. In the next investigation we consider a simpler example and look at some ways to connect the variables involved in a career choice.  Sales on Commission  Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment. He will be paid $1000 per month plus a 6% commission on his sales. The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month. To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations.  Based on the sales manager's estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job? What annual salary would that provide?  What would Delbert's monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute the monthly incomes for each sales totals shown in the table.    Sales  Income                           Plot your data points on a graph, using sales, , on the horizontal axis and income, , on the vertical axis, as shown in the figure. Connect the data points to show Delbert's monthly income for all possible monthly sales totals.  graph  Add two new data points to the table by reading values from your graph.

Use the description in the problem to help you:  He will be paid: $1000 plus a 6% commission on his sales.  Income  Test your formula from part (5) to see if it gives the same results as those you recorded in the table.  Use your formula to find out what monthly sales total Delbert would need in order to have a monthly income of $2500.  Each increase of $1000 in monthly sales increases Delbert's monthly income by .  Summarize the results of your work: In your own words, describe the relationship between Delbert's monthly sales and his monthly income. Include in your discussion a description of your graph.    Tables, Graphs, and Equations  In the Investigation you studied the connection between the variables Sales and Income for a part-time job. You created a mathematical model for that situation.  Mathematical Model  A mathematical model mathematical model model is a simplified description of reality that uses mathematics to help us understand a system or process.  We can use a model to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change. The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between the variables involved.  QuickCheck 1 What is the first step in creating a mathematical model?   Solve the equation.  Analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change.  Describe the relationships between the variables involved.  Make a table of values.   Starting from a description in words, we can represent the relationship by: a table of values  a graph, or by  an algebraic equation  Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.  A table of values table of values lists specific data points with precise numerical values.  A graph graph is a visual display of the data. It is easier to spot trends and describe the overall behavior of the variables from a graph.  An algebraic equation algebraic equation equation algebraic is a compact summary of the model. It can be used to analyze the model and to make predictions.   Look back at the Investigation to see how each of these modeling tools featured in your work.  QuickCheck 2 Name three ways to represent a relationship between variables.  In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools and how each contributes to the model.  In May 2005, the city of Lyons, France, started a bicycle rental program. Over 3,000 bicycles are available at 350 computerized stations around the city. Each of the 52,000 subscribers pays an annual 5 euro fee (about $7.20) and gets a PIN to access the bicycles. The bicycles rent for 1 euro per hour and can be returned to any station.  Your community decides to set up a similar program, charging a $5 subscription fee and $3 an hour for rental. (A fraction of an hour is charged as the corresponding fraction of $3).   Make a table of values showing the cost, , of renting a bike for various lengths of time, .  Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.  Write an equation for in terms of .    There is an initial fee of $5, and a rental fee of $3 per hour. To find the cost, we multiply the rental time by $3 per hour, and add the result to the $5 subscription fee. For example, the cost of a one-hour bike ride is A one-hour bike ride costs $8.  We calculate the cost for the other values of and record the results in a table as shown below.     Length of rental (hours)  Cost of rental (dollars)                         Each pair of values represents a point on the graph. The first value gives the horizontal coordinate of the point, and the second value gives the vertical coordinate.  The points lie on a straight line, as shown in the figure. The line extends infinitely in only one direction, because negative values of do not make sense here.  graph  To write an equation, we let represent the cost of the rental, and we use for the number of hours:     For more help on plotting points, see Section 1.1.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Write an equation for the cost of renting a bicycle for hours if the subscription fee is $7 and the rental fee is $2.50 per hour.  Hint: Fill in the correct numbers in the equation below.     Equations for Linear Models  The equation we wrote in Example 1.1.4 , , is an example of a linear model , which describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. The cost of renting a bicycle increased at a constant rate of $3 every hour.  Linear Model linear model  A linear model linear model describes a variable that increases or decreases at a constant rate. It has the form   QuickCheck 3 What sort of variables can be described by a linear model?   Increasing variables  Variables that change at a constant rate  Variables that describe time  Variables that can be graphed   For more help on writing a linear model, see Section 1.1.1 of the Toolkit.  The connections between an equation and its graph can give us useful information about a model. In the next Example we see how to use this idea.   Use the equation you found in to answer the following questions. Then show how to find the answers by using the graph.   How much will it cost to rent a bicycle for 6 hours?  How long can you bicycle for $18.50?    We substitute into the equation to find A 6-hour bike ride will cost $23. The point on the graph in the figure represents the cost of a 6-hour bike ride. The value on the -axis at the same height as point is 23, so a 6-hour bike ride costs $23.   We substitute into the equation and solve for .  For $18.50 you can bicycle for hours. The point on the graph represents an $18.50 bike ride. The value on the -axis below point is 4.5, so $18.50 will buy a 4.5 hour bike ride.  line though points    For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.1.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 2 In the preceding Example, how long can you bicycle for $9.50?  Hint: Start by finding $9.50 on the Cost (vertical axis). Then find the point on the graph with -coordinate $9.50. Finally, find the -coordinate of that point.  1.5 hours  In , note the different algebraic techniques we used in parts (a) and (b):   In part (a) we were given a value of and we evaluated the expression  to find .  In part (b) we were given a value of and we solved the equation  to find .   QuickCheck 4 Consider the expression . Finding a value of when we know is called . Finding a value of when we know is called .  In the examples above, the graph is increasing increasing graph graph increasing as increases. In the next Example we consider a decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing graph decreasing function graph decreasing graph decreasing decreasing function .  Leon's camper has a 20-gallon gas tank, and he gets 12 miles to the gallon. (Note that getting 12 miles to the gallon is the same as using gallon of gas per mile.)   Write an equation for the amount of gasoline, , left in Leon's tank after he has driven for miles.  Make a table of values for the equation.  Graph the equation.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gas left, how many miles has he driven since his last fill-up? Illustrate on the graph.    We use the form for a linear model, However, in this problem, instead of variables and , we use and . Leon's fuel tank started with 20 gallons, and the amount of gasoline is decreasing at a rate of gallon for every mile that he drives. Thus,  Every time Leon drives 12 miles, he uses another gallon of gasoline. So, to make the calculations easier, we choose values that are divisible by 12.     (miles)       (gallons)       We scale the values of along the horizontal axis, and the values of along the vertical axis. Then we plot the points from the table and connect with a line, as shown in the figure below.  If Leon has less than 5 gallons of gasoline left, then , as shown on the -axis. Using our model from part (a), we solve the inequality.  Leon has driven at least 180 miles. The solution is shown on the graph below.   gas mileage   For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  In part (d) of the previous Example we used an inequality inequality to answer the question. We use inequalities to model English phrases such as \"less than,\" \"more than,\" \"at least,\" and \"at most.\"  Practice 3 Leon forgot to reset his odometer after his last fill-up, but he thinks he has driven at least 150 miles. How much gas does he have left? Show this on the graph.  Hint: Locate 150 miles on the -axis. What part of the axis represents \"at least\" 150 miles?

  "body": "Graphs and Equations  Equations and Solutions  In the last section we studied some linear models, and in particular we looked at graphs and equations that described those models. In this section we review some techniques and terminology related to equations, inequalities, and their graphs.  Solution  A solution solution to an equation in one variable of an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true.  For example, is a solution of the equation because .  QuickCheck 1 Which of the following values are solutions of the equation         For more help on checking for a solution, see Section 1.2.1 of the Toolkit.  A linear equation has no powers of the variable other than 1. It has at most one solution. We find the solution by transforming the equation into a simpler equivalent equation whose solution is obvious.  Solve the equation  We begin by simplifying each side of the equation.  The solution is . You can check that substituting into the original equation produces a true statement.  For more help on solving linear equations, see Section 1.2.2 of the Toolkit.  Practice 1 Find the solution of the equation .   Linear Inequalities linear inequality inequality linear  Although a linear equation can have at most one solution, a linear inequality can have many solutions. For example, complete the table of values for the expression :                      Now use your table to list at least three solutions of the inequality .  Use algebra to solve the inequality .  We begin by isolating the term containing the variable, just as we do when solving a linear equation. We subtract 5 from both sides to obtain Then we divide both sides by to find Any value of greater than is a solution of the inequality. We write the solutions as . Because we cannot list all of these solutions, we often illustrate them as a graph on a number line , as shown below.  number line for inequality   In the Example above, we used the following rule for solving linear inequalities.  Solving a Linear Inequality linear inequality inequality linear  If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.   Other than the rule stated in the box above, the rules for solving a linear inequality are the same as the rules for solving a linear equation.  For more help on solving linear inequalities, see Section 1.1.4 of the Toolkit.  QuickCheck 2 Which of the following show the correct solutions of the inequality?   has solution  has solution  has solution  has solution   Practice 2 Solve the inequality , and graph the solutions on a number line.  number line for inequality    Equations in Two Variables equation in two variables  An equation in two variables , such as has many solutions. Each solution solution to an equation in two variables consists of an ordered pair of values, one for and one for , that together satisfy the equation (make the equation true.)  QuickCheck 3 What is the solution of an equation in two variables?   A value of that makes the equation true  An ordered pair of values that satisfy the equation  Solving the equation for in terms of  The graph of the equation    Is a solution of the equation ?  Is a solution of the equation ?    The ordered pair is a solution of the equation above, because it satifies the equation.  The ordered pair is not a solution, because it does not satify the equation.   For more help on finding solutions of an equation in two variables, see Section 1.2.3 of the Toolkit.  Practice 3 Find some more solutions of the equation and complete the table of values:                                 Because an equation in two variables may have many solutions, we can use a graph to visualize those solutions.  Graph graph  The graph graph of an equation in two variables is just a picture of all its solutions.   You might think it would be difficult to find all the solutions of an equation, but for a linear equation , we can at least illustrate the solutions: all the solutions lie on a straight line. (Later on we can prove that this is true.)  QuickCheck 4 True or false?  All the solutions of a linear equation in two variables lie on a straight line.  The equation is a linear equation.  The graph of an equation in two variables is a picture of its solutions.  If a point lies on the graph of an equation, it is a solution of the equation.   The figure shows a graph of the equation . Which of the following equations are true?     line and points   The point lies on the graph, so , is a solution of the equation. Thus, , or is a true statement.  The point does not lie on the graph, so , does not satisfy the equation, and is a not true.  The point does lie on the graph, so , does satisfy the equation, and is a true statement.  Practice 4 On the grid below, plot the points you found in Practice 3. All the points should lie on a straight line; draw the line with a ruler or straightedge. Which of the following points lie on the graph?  grid       Which of the points above satisfy the equation in Practice 3? grid  lies on the graph and satisfies the equation.   Graphical Solution of Equations and Inequalities equation graphical solution  Here is a clever way to solve an equation in one variable by using a graph. Suppose we would like to solve the equation . We start by looking at the graph of .  Use the graph of to solve the equation   Compare the two equations in the problem. In the equation we want to solve, has been replaced by . We begin by locating the point on the graph for which .  Next we find the -coordinate of point by drawing an imaginary line from straight down to the -axis. The -coordinate of is .   function graph  Thus, is the point , and when . The solution we seek is .  You can verify the solution algebraically by substituting into the equation:  Does ?    The relationship between an equation and its graph is an important one. For the previous example, make sure you understand that the following three statements are equivalent.   The point lies on the graph of .  The ordered pair is a solution of the equation .  is a solution of the equation .   Practice 5   Use the graph of to solve the equation . Follow the steps:  Step 1: Locate the point on the graph with .  Step 2: Find the -coordinate of your point .   Verify your solution algebraically.   line  We can also use graphs to solve inequalities. Consider the inequality To solve this inequality means to find all values of that make the expression greater than or equal to 150. We could begin by trying some values of . Here is a table obtained by evaluating .                      From the table, we see that values of less than or equal to 8 are solutions of the inequality, but we have not checked all possible -values. We can get a more complete picture from a graph.  Use the graph of the equation to solve the inequality   We look for points on the graph with -coordinates greater than or equal to 150. These points are shown in color. Which -values produced these points?  We can read the -coordinates by dropping straight down to the -axis, as shown by the arows. For example, the -value corresponding to is . For larger values of , we must choose -values less than 9. Thus, all values of less than or equal to 9 are solutions, as shown on the -axis.  linear inequality  We write the solutions as .   Practice 6   Use the graph of to solve the inequality . Follow the steps:  Step 1: Locate the point on the graph with .  Step 2: Find the -coordinate of the point .  Step 3: Which points on the graph have ? Mark them on the graph.  Step 4: Find the -coordinates of the points in Step 3. Mark them all on the -axis.   Verify your solution algebraically.   line   Using a Graphing Utility  We can use a graphing utility to graph equations if they are written in the form . First, let's review how to solve an equation for in terms of .  Solve the equation for in terms of .  To begin, we isolate the -term by subtracting from both sides of the equation. Note that the equation now has the form of the linear models we saw in Section 1.1 .  Practice 7 Solve for in terms of :  Now we are ready to graph an equation with technology. For most graphing utilities, we follow three steps.  To Graph an Equation   Enter the equation you wish to graph.  Select a graphing window.  Graph.   Choosing a graphing window corresponds to drawing the - and -axes and marking a scale on each axis when we graph by hand. The standard graphing window displays values from to on both axes. We can start with this window and then adjust it if necessary.  Use a graphing utility to graph the equation .  First, we solve the equation for in terms of .  Now enter after , and choose the standard graphing window. The graph is shown at right.  Graphing calculator line   Don't forget to erase your graph when you are done.  Practice 8  Solve the equation for in terms of .  Graph the equation in the standard window.    graph   We can use the TRACE feature to find the coordinates of points on a graph.  Use a graph to find a solution to the equation with -coordinate .  First we graph the equation in the window   Xmin   Xmax   Ymin   Ymax   GC trace  We press TRACE , and a \"bug\" begins flashing on the display. The coordinates of the bug appear at the bottom of the display, as shown in the figure. We use the left and right arrows to move the bug along the graph. You can check that the coordinates of the point do satisfy the equation .   Practice 9  Graph the equation in the window:   Xmin  Xmax  Xscl  Ymin  Ymax  Yscl   Use the Trace feature to find the point that has -coordinate .
