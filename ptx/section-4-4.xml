<title>Quadratic Inequalities</title>

<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities Graphically</title>

<p>The easiest way to solve a quadratic inequality is with a graph.</p>

<example xml:id="example-fireworks"><statement><p>The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than <m>800</m> feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by
        <me>h = 256t - 16t^2</me>
When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown below.</p>
        <sidebyside  width="50%"><image source="images/fig-fireworks"><description>graph of fireworks height</description></image> </sidebyside>
<p>We would like to know when the rocket's height is greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of <m>t</m> is <m>h \gt 800</m>? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality
        <me>256t - 16t^2 \gt 800</me>
Points on the graph with <m>h \gt 800</m> are shown in color, and the <m>t</m>-coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.</p> 
         
<p>From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately <m>4.25</m> seconds to <m>11.75</m> seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all <m>t</m>-values greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>.</p></solution></example>

<note><p>The solution set in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/> is called a <term>compound inequality</term><idx>compound inequality</idx>, because it involves more than one inequality symbol. We write this inequality as
    <me>4.25 \lt t \lt 11.75</me>
and read "<m>t</m> greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>."</p></note>

<p>You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/>. Graph the two functions
        <md><mrow>Y_1 \amp= 256X - 16X^2</mrow>

<p>Then use the intersect feature to find the points where the two graphs intersect, at about <m>x=4.26</m> and <m>x=11.74</m>. Both these points <m>y</m>-coordinate <m>800</m>, and between the points the parabola is above the line, so <m>h \gt 800</m> when <m>4.26 \lt t \lt 11.74</m>.</p>  </technology>

<subsection><title>Using the <m>x</m>-Intercepts</title>

<p>Because it is easy to decide whether the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point on a graph is positive or negative (the point lies above the <m>x</m>-axis or below the <m>x</m>-axis), we often rewrite a given inequality so that one side is zero.  
</p>  
    
<example xml:id="example-quadratic-inequality"><statement><p>Use a graph to solve <m>x^2 - 2x - 3 \ge 12</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We first write the inequality with zero on one side: 
    <me>x^2 - 2x - 15 \ge 0</me>. 
We would like to find points on the graph of <m>~y = x^2 - 2x - 15</m> that have <m>y</m>-coordinates greater than or equal to zero. A graph of the equation is shown below.</p>
    <sidebyside widths="60% 35%" valigns="middle middle" margins="0%">
<p>You can check that the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>-3</m> and <m>5</m>. The points shown in blue on the graph lie above the <m>x</m>-axis and have <m>y \ge 0</m>, so the <m>x</m>-coordinates of these points are the solutions of the inequality.</p>  
    <image source="images/fig-quadratic-inequality"><description>parabola dividing the x-axis into three regions</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>Note that the solutions lie in two intervals, less than <m>-3</m> or greater than <m>5</m>. Thus, the solution is <m>x \le -3</m> or <m>x \ge 5</m>.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>In Example 2, the solution of the inequality <m>~x^2 - 2x - 15 \ge 0~</m> is the set of values
    <me>x \le -3~~ \text{or}  ~~x \ge 5</me>
This set is another type of compound inequality, and its graph consists of two pieces. Therefore, we cannot write the solution as a single inequality. For instance, it would be <em>incorrect</em> to describe the solution set as <m>~-3 \ge x \ge 5~</m>, because this notation implies that <m>-3 \ge 5</m>.  We must write the solution as two parts: <m>x \le -3</m> or <m>x \ge 5</m>.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Interval Notation</title>

<p>The solution set in Example 1, namely <m>4.26 \lt t \lt 11.74</m>, is called an interval.  An <term>interval</term> is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. An interval may include one or both of its endpoints.</p>

<assemblage><title>Interval Notation</title>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li>The <term>closed interval</term> <m>[a,b]</m> is the set <m>a \le x \le b</m>.</li>
    <li>The <term>open interval</term> <m>(a,b)</m> is the set <m>a \lt x \lt b</m>.</li>
    <li>Intervals may also be <term>half-open</term> or <term>half-closed</term>.</li>
    <li>The <term>infinite interval</term> <m>[a,\infty)</m> is the set <m>x \ge a</m>.</li>
    <li>The <term>infinite interval</term> <m>9-\infty,a]</m> is the set <m>x \le a</m>.</li></ol></p></assemblage>

<p>The symbol <m>\infty</m>, infinity, does not represent a specific real number; it indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line. A set consisting of two or more intervals is called the <term>union</term> of the intervals. For example, the solution to Example 2 is denoted in interval notation by <m>(-\infty,-3)\cup (5, \infty)</m>.</p>
<p>Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.</p>

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically</title>

<p>Although a graph is very helpful in solving inequalities, it is not completely necessary. Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms
    <md><mrow>ax^2 + bx + c \amp\lt 0\text{,}
        \amp\hphantom{blank} ax^2 + bx + c \amp\gt 0</mrow>
        <mrow>ax^2 + bx + c \amp\le 0\text{,}
        \amp\hphantom{blank} ax^2 + bx + c \amp\ge 0</mrow></md>
All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m> opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown below.</p>
    <sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-two-parabolas" ><description>parabola opens up, the other opens down</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>The parabola in figure (a) opens upward. It crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at two points, <m>x = r_1</m> and <m>x = r_2</m>. At these points, <m>y = 0</m>. </p><p>
    <ul><li><p>The graph lies below the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\lt 0</m> lie between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.</p></li> 
        <li><p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x</m>-values less than <m>r_1</m> or greater than <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> are <m>x\lt r_1</m> or <m>x\gt r_2</m>.</p></li>
    </ul></p>
<p>If the parabola opens downward, as in figure (b), the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> lie between the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and the solutions to <m>y\lt 0</m> lie outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p>
<p>From the graphs, we see that the <m>x</m>-intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive <m>y</m>-coordinates and the portions with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the <m>x</m>-axis produce the correct sign for <m>y</m>.</p>

<assemblage><title>To solve a quadratic inequality algebraically</title>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li>Write the inequality in standard form:  One side is zero, and the other has the form  <m>ax^2+bx+c</m>.</li>
    <li>Find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>~y=ax^2+bx+c</m> by setting <m>y=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>.</li>
    <li>Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of <m>a</m> to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.</li>

    <li><p>Consider the equation <m>y = 16 + 6x - x^2</m>. To locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts, we set <m>y = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.

    The <m>x</m>-intercepts are <m>x = -2</m> and <m>x = 8</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Make a rough sketch of the graph of <m>y = 16 + 6x - x^2</m>, as shown below. Because <m>a = -1 \lt 0</m>, the graph is a parabola that opens downward.</p>

    <li><p>We are interested in points on the graph for which <m>y\le 0</m>. The points with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates (that is, points below the <m>x</m>-axis) lie outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph, so the solution of the inequality is <m>x\le -2</m> or <m>x\ge 8</m>. Or, using interval notation, the solution is <m>(-\infty,-2] \cup  [8,\infty)</m>.</p></li>
    </ol></p></solution></example>

<warning><p>Many people think that the inequality signs in the solution should point in the same direction as the sign in the original problem, and hence would incorrectly write the solution to <xref ref="example-quadratic-inequality2" text="type-global"/> as <m>x \le -2</m> or <m>x \le 8</m>.

            or, subtracting <m>2000</m> from both sides,
                    <me>-0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200 \gt 0</me></p></li>
        <li><p>Consider the function
                    <me>y = -0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200</me>
            We locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph by setting <m>y = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>. We will use the quadratic formula to solve the equation
                    <me>-0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200 = 0</me>
            so <m>a = \alert{-0.8}</m>, <m>b = \alert{320}</m>, and <m>c = \alert{-27,200}</m>. We substitute these values into the quadratic formula to obtain                    
                <md><mrow>x \amp=\frac{-(\alert{320})\pm\sqrt{(\alert{320})^2 - 4(-0.8)(\alert{-27,200})}} {2(\alert{-0.8})}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{-320\pm\sqrt{102,400 - 87,040}}{-1.6}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=\frac{-320\pm\sqrt{15,360}}{-1.6}</mrow></md>
            To two decimal places, the solutions to the equation are <m>122.54</m> and <m>277.46</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The graph of the function is a parabola that opens downward, because the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is negative. </p>
                <sidebyside  width="40%"><image source="images/fig-quadratic-inequality3"><description>graph of parabola opening down</description></image></sidebyside></li>
            <li><p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis, and hence <m>y \gt 0</m>, for <m>x</m>-values between the two <m>x</m>-intercepts, that is, for <m>122.54 \lt x \lt 277.46</m>. Because we cannot produce a fraction of a parka, we restrict the interval to the closest whole number <m>x</m>-values included, namely <m>123</m> and <m>277</m>.</p>
            <p>Thus, TrailGear can produce as few as <m>123</m> parkas or as many as <m>277</m> parkas per month to keep its profit above $<m>2000</m>.</p></li>
