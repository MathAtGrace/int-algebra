        The models we have explored so far are linear models; their graphs are straight lines. In this chapter, we investigate problems where the graph may change from increeasing to decreasing, or vice versa. The simplest sort of function that models this behavior is a quadratic function, one that involves the square of the variable.

        Around 1600, Galileo began to study the motion of falling objects. He used a ball rolling down an inclined plane or ramp to slow down the motion, but he had no accurate way to measure time; clocks had not been invented yet. So he used water running into a jar to mark equal time intervals.

            After many trials, Galileo found that the ball traveled 1 unit of distance down the plane in the first time interval, 3 units in the second time interval, 5 units in the third time interval, and so on, as shown in the figure, with the distances increasing through odd units of distance as time went on.

    <p>
        The total distance traveled by the ball can be modeled by the equation, <m>d = kt^2</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant. Galileo found that this relationship holds no matter how steep he made the ramp. If we plot the height of the ball (rather than the distance traveled) as a function of time, we obtain a portion of the graph of a quadratic function.
