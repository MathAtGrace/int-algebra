<p><title>Intermediate Algebra: Functions and Graphs</title> was written to incorporate the benefits of technology and the philosophy of the reform movement into algebra for college students. It continues the emphasis on modeling, problem solving, and graphing established in <title>Introductory Algebra</title>.</p> 

<paragraphs><title>Modeling</title>
<p>
    The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. We motivate the skills and techniques of algebra by placing them in the context of simple applications. Each chapter begins with an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore open-ended modeling problems. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.

<paragraphs><title>Functions</title>
<p>
    The fundamental concept underlying calculus and related disciplines is the notion of function. While the formal study of functions is usually the content of precalculus, it is not too early to begin building an intuitive understanding of functional relationships in the preceding algebra courses. These ideas are useful not only in calculus but in practically any field students may pursue. We begin working with functions in Chapter 1, "Linear Models." Chapter 2 considers applications of linear models, and Chapters 3 and 4 study quadratic models. Formal function notation and terminology appear in Chapter 5, after students have had an opportunity to absorb the meaning behind the notation.
</p>
<p>
    In our work with functions and modeling we employ the "Rule of Four," that all problems should be considered using algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal methods. It is the connections between these approaches that we have endeavored to establish in this course. At this level it is crucial that students learn to write an algebraic expression from a verbal description, recognize trends in a  table of data, and extract and interpret information from the graph of a function.

<paragraphs><title>Graphs</title>
<p>
    No tool for conveying information about a system is more powerful than a graph. Yet many students have trouble progressing from a point-wise understanding of graphs to a more global view. We encourage students to become more involved with graphs by providing blank grids with appropriately scaled axes for most problems. These ready-made grids remove some of the drudgery of graphing and allow students to focus on the properties of the graphs, such as intercepts and slope, and on interpreting the information given by the graph. Later, we take advantage of graphing calculators to examine large numbers of examples and study them in more detail than is possible when every graph is plotted by hand. We consider more realistic models in which calculations by more traditional methods are difficult or impossible.
</p>
<p>
    We have incorporated the use of graphing technology into the text wherever they can be used to enhance understanding. Technology use is not simply an add-on, but in many ways shapes the organization of the material. The text includes instructions for the TI-83 graphing calculator, but these can easily be adapted to any other graphing utility. We have not attempted to use all the features of the calculator or to teach calculator use for its own sake, but in all cases have let the mathematics suggest how technology should be used.

<paragraphs><title>Content</title>
<p>
    <title>Intermediate Algebra</title> includes the material found in a typical algebra course, along with an introduction to curve-fitting. The order of topics and their presentation is organized around families of functions and their applications. Appendix A includes review material on polynomial products and factoring, laws of exponents, and facts from geometry. Appendix B provides a note on the structure of the real number system and an introduction to complex numbers.
