<p>In Chapter 7 we used logarithms to solve exponential equations. Recall that a logarithm is really an exponent, so that, for example, <m>\log_2 {(16)}</m> means "what exponent on base 2 will give me 16?" The answer of course is 4, so <m>\log_2 {(16)} = 4</m>.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we consider functions defined in terms of logartihms, and logarithmic functions as models in their own right. A logarithmic function looks like <m>f(x) = \log_b {(x)}</m>, where <m>b</m> is the base and <m>x</m> is a positive number. In Chapter 7 we saw that the base 10 logarithms, or common logarithms, appeared in many applications. Now we will also study another base for exponential and logarithmic functions, the natural base <m>e</m>, which is the most useful base for most scientific applications.</p>

<p>An interesting example of a logarithmic model arises in psychology. In 1885, the German philosopher Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted one of the first experiments on memory, using himself as a subject. He memorized lists of nonsense syllables and then tested his memory of the syllables at intervals ranging from 20 minutes to 31 days. After one hour, he remembered less than 50% of the items, but he found that the rate of forgetting leveled off over time. He modeled his data by the function
    <me>y = \frac{184}{2.88 \log {(t)} + 1.84}</me></p>

<p>Ebbinghaus's model uses a logarithmic function. The graph of the data, shown above with <m>t</m> in minutes and <m>y</m> in percents, is called the "forgetting curve." Ebbinghaus's work, including his application of the scientific method to his research, provides part of the foundation of modern psychology.</p>
