    The <m>x</m>-intercept of the graph shown above is <m>(−3, 0)</m>, and its <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, 4)</m>.

<subsection><title>Meaning of the Intercepts</title>
<p>
    The intercepts of a graph give us information about the situation it models.
</p>


<example>
    <statement>
        <p>What do the intercepts of the graph in the Example above tell us about the problem situation?</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
            The <m>d</m>-intercept tells us that when <m>d = 240</m>, <m>g = 0</m>, or that when Leon has traveled 240 miles, he has 0 gallons of gasoline left; the fuel tank is empty. The <m>g</m>-intercept tells us that when <m>d = 0</m>, <m>g = 20</m>, or that when Leon has traveled 0 miles, he has 20 gallons of gasoline left. The fuel tank holds 20 gallons when full.
        </p>
    </solution>

<subsection><title>General Form for a Linear Equation</title>

<p>
    The graphs of the equations we have seen so far are all portions of straight lines. For this reason such equations are called <term>linear equations</term>.
</p>
<p>
    The order of the terms in the equation does not matter. For example, the equation in <xref ref="example-bicycle" text="type-global"/> of <xref ref="LinMod" text="type-global" />
    <md>
        <mrow>\amp C=5+3t \amp \amp \text{ can be written equivalently as } \amp -3t + C=5</mrow>
    </md>
    and the equation in <xref ref="Leon-camper" text="type-global"/> of that section,
    <md>
        <mrow>\amp g=20-\frac{1}{12}d \amp \amp \text{ can be written  as } \amp \frac{1}{12}d+g=20 </mrow>
    </md>
</p>
<p>
    This form of a linear equation, <m>Ax +By = C</m>, is called the <term>general form</term>.
</p>



<definition><title>General Form for a Linear Equation</title>
    <p>
        The <term>general form</term><idx>general form</idx> for a linear equation is
        <md><mrow>\blert{Ax+By=C} </mrow></md>
        (where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> cannot both be 0).
    </p>
