<subsection><title>Growth Factors</title>

<p>Researchers often use cell lines from the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> to study protein interactions related to cancer and other diseases.  From 60% to 70% of human disease genes are found in <em>Drosophila</em> cells, and gene discoveries in the flies have led to parallel studies in vertebrates.</p>

<p>One milliliter of culture contains about 1 million <em>Drosophila</em> cells, and the population doubles every 24 hours. The table shows the population, <m>P(t)</m>, of <em>Drosophila</em> cells, in millions, as a function of time in days.</p>

<p>The function  describes <term>exponential growth</term>.  During each time interval of a fixed length the population is <em>multiplied</em> by a certain constant amount, in this case by 2. Because the population grew by a factor of 2 every day, we say that 2 is the <term>growth factor</term> for the function. Functions that describe exponential growth can be expressed in a standard form.</p>

<assemblage><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>The function
    <me>P(t)=P_0 b^t</me> 
describes <term>exponential growth</term>, where <m>P_0=P(0)</m> is the <term>initial value</term> of the function and <m>b</m> is the <term>growth factor</term>.</p></assemblage>

<note><p>Look carefully at the difference between a power function, <m>f(x) = kx^p</m>, and this new exponential growth function, <m>P(t)=P_0 b^t</m>. The power function has the variable as its base, and the exponent is a constant.  In the exponential growth function, the base is a constant and the exponent is a variable.</p></note>

<p>For the <em>Drosophila</em> cell population, we have
    <me>P(t)=1 \cdot 2^t</me>
so <m>P_0 = 1</m> and <m>b=2</m>. We can verify that this formula returns the values in the table above. For example, after <m>\alert{4}</m> days we have
    <me>P(\alert{4}) = 1 \cdot 2^\alert{4} = 16</me>
as recorded in the table.</p>

<example><statement><p>In 1985, there were about 1.2 million cell phone users world-wide. Since that time, the number has grown by a factor of 1.5 each year.<ol label="a">
    <li>Make a table of values and graph the function.</li>
    <li>Write a formula for the number, <m>C(t)</m>, of cell phone users <m>t</m> years after 1985.</li>
    <li>How many cell phone users does the formula predict for the year 2000?</li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>We let <m>t=0</m> in 1985, so <m>C(0)=1.2</m>, in millions. Each value of <m>C(t)</m> can be obtained by multiplying the previous value by the growth factor, 1.5.</p>

    <li>The initial value of the function is <m>C_0 = C(0) = 1.2</m> million. The annual growth factor is <m>b=1.5</m>, so the formula is
        <me>C(t) = 1.2(1.5)^t</me></li>
    <li>The year 2000 is 15 years after 1985, so we evaluate the function for <m>t = \alert{15}</m>. 
        <me>C(\alert{15}) = 1.2(1.5)^{\alert{15}} = 525.47</me>
    The formula predicts that over 525 million people used cell phones in 2000.</li></ol></p></solution></example>

<p>In the examples above, you can see that the graphs of the functions are not linear. In each case, the function grows slowly at first, but eventually grows faster and faster.</p>

<warning><p>Be careful when evaluating exponential growth functions.  In Example 1c, note that 
    <me>1.2\blert{(1.5)^{15}} = 1.2 \times \blert{437.89} = 525.47~~~~~~~\blert{\text{Compute the power first.}}</me>              
According to the order of operations, we compute the power <m>1.5^{15}</m> first, and then multiply the result by 1.2.</p></warning>

<p><m>L</m> is a linear function with <m>y</m>-intercept <m>5</m> and slope <m>2</m>; <m>E</m> is an exponential function with initial value <m>5</m> and growth factor <m>2</m>. In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing.</p>
    
<p> However, for each unit increase in <m>t</m>, <m>2</m> units are <em>added</em> to the value of <m>L(t)</m>, whereas the value of <m>E(t)</m> is <em>multiplied</em> by <m>2</m>. An exponential function with growth factor <m>2</m> eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope <m>2</m>, as you can see by comparing the graphs or the function values in the tables.</p>

<example xml:id="example-compare-linear-vs-exponential"><statement>
<p>A solar energy company sold $<m>80,000</m> worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to $<m>88,000</m>. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next 3 years.<ol label="a">
    <li>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow linearly, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow linearly.</li>
    <li>If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow exponentially, what sales total should it expect next year? Graph the projected sales figures over the next 3 years, assuming that sales will grow exponentially.</li>
    </ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Let <m>L(t)</m> represent the company's total sales <m>t</m> years after starting business, where <m>t = 0</m> is the first year of operation. If sales grow linearly, then <m>L(t)</m> has the form <m>L(t) = mt + b</m>. Because <m>L(0) = 80,000</m>, the intercept <m>b</m> is <m>80,000</m>. The slope <m>m</m> of the graph is
        <me>\dfrac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}= \dfrac{8000 \text{ dollars}}{1\text{ year}}= 8000 \text{ dollars/year}</me>
    where <m>\Delta S = 8000</m> is the increase in sales during the first year. Thus, <m>L(t) = 8000t + 80,000</m>, and sales grow by adding $<m>8000</m> each year. The expected sales total for the next year is
            <me>L(2) = 8000(2) + 80,000 = 96,000</me></p></li>
    <li><p>Let <m>E(t)</m> represent the company's sales assuming that sales will grow exponentially. Then <m>E(t)</m> has the form <m>E(t) = E_0 b^t</m>, and the initial value is <m>E_0 = 80,000</m>. We find the growth factor in sales over the first year by dividing <m>E(1)</m> by <m>E_0</m>:
        <md><mrow>E(1) \amp = E_0 b^1</mrow>
            <mrow> \text{so}~~b \amp = \dfrac{E(1)}{E_0} = \dfrac{88,000}{80,000} = 1.1</mrow></md> 
    Thus, <m>E(t) = 80,000(1.1)^t</m>, and the expected sales total for the next year is
            <me>E(2) = 80,000(1.10)^2= 96,800</me></p></li>
    </ol></p>
    <p>We evaluate each function at several points to obtain the graphs shown in the figure.</p>

<subsection><title>Exponential Decay</title>

<p>In the examples above, exponential growth was modeled by increasing functions of the form
    <me>P(t) = P_0 b^t</me>
 where the growth factor, <m>b</m>, is a number greater than 1. If we multiply the function value by a number smaller than 1, the function values will decrease. Thus, if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>, then <m>P(t) = P_0b^t</m> is a <em>decreasing</em> function. In this case, we say that the function describes <term>exponential decay</term>, and the constant <m>b</m> is called the <term>decay factor</term><idx>decay factor</idx>.</p>

<subsection><title>Percent Increase</title>

<p>Exponential growth is often described as growth by a certain percent increase. Suppose the town of Lakeview had 4000 residents in the year 2000, and grew at a rate of 5% per year. This means that each year we add 5% of last year's population to find the current population, <m>P(t)</m>. Thus
    <md><mrow>\text{In 2000,} ~~P(0) \amp = 4000</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{In 2001,}~~P(1) \amp = 4000 + \blert{0.05(4000)} = 4200 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 5% of}~P(0).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{In 2002,}~~P(2) \amp = 4200 + \blert{0.05(4200)} = 4410 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Add 5% of}~P(1).}</mrow></md>
and so on. Now here is the important observation about percent increase:</p>  

<p><me>\text{Adding 5% of the old population is the same as multiplying the old population by 1.05.}</me>

    <md><mrow>4000 + 0.05(4000) \amp = 4000(1+0.05) = 4000(1.05) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor out 4000.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>4200 + 0.05(4200) \amp = 4200(1+0.05) = 4200(1.05) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor out 4000.}}</mrow></md></p>

<p>Thus, we can find the current population by multiplying the old population by 1.05. In other words,</p>

 <p><me>\text{Growing by 5% is the same as growing by a factor of 1.05.}</me></p>  

<p>A formula for the population of Lakeview  years after 2000 is
    <me>P(t) = 4000(1.05)</me> 
This formula describes exponential growth with a growth factor of <m>b=1.05</m>. In general, a function that grows at a percent rate <m>r</m>, where <m>r</m> is expressed as a decimal, has a growth factor of <m>b=1+r</m>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Growth by a Constant Percent</title>
    <p>The function
        <me>P(t) =P_0 (1+r)^t</me>
    describes exponential growth at a constant percent rate of growth, <m>r</m>.</p>
    <p> The <term>initial value</term> of the function is <m>P_0 = P(0)</m>, and <m>b=1+r</m> is the <term>growth factor</term>.</p></assemblage>

<p>Many quantities besides population can grow by a fixed percent. For example, an inflation rate gives the percent rate at which prices are rising.</p>

<example><statement><p>During a period of rapid inflation, prices rose by 12% each year. At the beginning of this time, a loaf of bread cost $2.<ol label="a">
    <li>Make a table showing the cost of bread over the next four years.</li>
    <li>Write a function that gives the price of a loaf of bread  years after inflation began.</li>
    <li>How much did a loaf of bread cost after 6 years?  After 30 months?</li>
    <li>Graph the function found in (b).</li>

<p>Compound interest is another example of exponential growth. Suppose you deposit a sum of money into an account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. Each year, 5% of your current balance is added to your account as interest, so your balance grows by a factor of 1.05. In general, we have the following formula.</p>

<assemblage><title>Compound Interest</title>
<p>If a <term>principal</term> of <m>P</m> dollars is invested in an account that pays an interest rate <m>r</m> compounded annually, the <term>balance</term> <m>B</m> after <m>t</m> years is given by
    <me>B=P(1+r)^t</me></p></assemblage>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Percent Decrease</title>

<p>We have seen that a percent increase of <m>r</m> (in decimal form) corresponds to a growth factor of <m>b=1+r</m>. A percent decrease of <m>r</m> corresponds to a decay factor of <m>b=1-r</m>. For example, if a population declines by 25% each year, then each year the new population is 75% of its previous value. So
    <me>b = 1-0.25  = 0.75</me>
and <m>P(t) = P_0 (0.75)^t</m>.  Remember that multiplying by <m>b</m> gives us the population remaining, not the amount of decline.</p>

<example><statement><p>According to <em>Context</em> magazine: "Computing prices have been falling exponentially for the past 30 years and will probably stay on that curve for another couple of decades." In fact, prices have been falling at a rate of 37% every year. Suppose an accounting firm invests $50,000 in new computer equipment.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write a formula for the value <m>V(t)</m> of the equipment <m>t</m> years from now.</li>
    <li>What will the equipment be worth in 5 years?</li>
    <li>Graph the function <m>V(t)</m> for <m>0 \le t \le 20</m>.</li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>The initial value of the equipment is <m>V_0 = 50,000</m>. Every year, the value of the equipment is     
        multiplied by
            <me>b=1-r=1-0.37 = 0.63</me>
        After <m>t</m> years, the value of the equipment is 
            <me>V(t)=50,000(0.63)^t</me></p></li>
    <li><p>After 5 years, we have

        The value of the equipment after 5 years is $4962.18.</p></li>
