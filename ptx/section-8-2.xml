<section xml:id="AlgebraicFractions"   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Algebraic Fractions</title>

<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

<p>An <term>algebraic fraction</term> (or <em>rational expression</em>, as they are someitmes called, is a fraction in which both numerator and denominator are fractions.  Here are some examples of algebraic fractions:
    <me>\dfrac{3}{x},~~~~~~\dfrac{a^2+1}{a-2},~~~~~~\text{and}~~~~~~\dfrac{z-1}{2z+3}</me>
We can evaluate algebraic fractions just as we evaluate any other algebraic expression.</p>

<warning><p>If we try to evaluate the fraction <m>\dfrac{a^2+1}{a-2}</m> for <m>a=2</m>, we get <m>\dfrac{2^2+1}{2-2}</m>  or <m>\dfrac{5}{0}</m>, which is undefined. When working with fractions, we must exclude any values of the variable that make the denominators equal to zero.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Reducing Fractions</title>

<p>You'll recall from your study of arithmetic that we can <term>reduce</term> a fraction if we can divide both numerator and denominator by a <term>common factor</term>.  In algebra, it is helpful to think of factoring out the common factor first.  For example,
    <me>\dfrac{27}{36} = \dfrac{\cancel{9} \cdot 3}{\cancel{9} \cdot 4} = \dfrac{3}{4}</me>
where we have divided both numerator and denominator by 9. The new fraction has the same value as the old one, namely 0.75, but it is simpler (the numbers are smaller.) Reducing is an application of the Fundamental Principle of Fractions.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Fundamental Principle of Fractions</title>
<p>We can multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero factor, and the new fraction will be equivalent to the old one.
    <me>\dfrac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot c} = \dfrac{a}{b}~~~~~~\text{if}~~~~~~b,c \ne 0</me></p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Reduce  <m>~\dfrac{8x^3y}{6x^2y^3}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The common factor for numerator and denominator is <m>2x^2y</m>.  We factor <m>2x^2y</m> from the numerator and denominator, then divide by the common factor.
    <me>\dfrac{8x^3y}{6x^2y^3} = \dfrac{4x \cdot \cancel{2x^2y}}{3y^2 \cdot \cancel{2x^2y}} = \dfrac{4x}{3y^2}</me></p>
</solution></example>

<exercise><title>Practice 1</title>
<statement><p>Reduce   <m>~\dfrac{-15ab^4}{25a^2b}</m></p></statement>
<answer><m>\dfrac{-3b^3}{5a}</m></answer></exercise>

<warning><p>When we cancel common factors, we are <em>dividing</em>. Because division is the inverse or opposite operation for multiplication, we can cancel common <em>factors</em>, but <em>we cannot cancel common terms</em>.
</p></warning>

<example><statement><p>Use your calculator to decide which calculation is correct. <ol label="a" cols="2">
        <li><m>\dfrac{12}{8} = \dfrac{4 \cdot 3}{4 \cdot 2} \rightarrow \dfrac{3}{2}</m></li>
        <li><m>\dfrac{7}{6} = \dfrac{4 + 3}{4 + 2} \rightarrow \dfrac{3}{2}</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p>We can cancel the 4's in part (a), because they are factors of numerator and denominator.  We cannot cancel the 4's in part (b), because they are terms.  You can verify that <m>\dfrac{12}{8} = \dfrac{3}{2}</m>, but <m>\dfrac{7}{6} \ne \dfrac{3}{2}</m>.</p></solution></example>

<answer><p>(a)</p></answer></exercise>

<p>If the numerator or denominator of the fraction contains more than one term, it is especially important to <em>factor before reducing</em>, so that numerator and denominator are written as products of factors, instead of sums of terms. </p>

<example><statement><p>Reduce each fraction. <ol label="a" cols="2">
        <li><m>\dfrac{4x+2}{4}</m></li>
        <li><m>\dfrac{9x^2+3}{6x+3}</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p>First we factor the numerator and denominator.  Then we divide numerator and denominator by any common factors.<ol label="a">
    <li><m>\dfrac{4x+2}{4} = \dfrac{\cancel{2}(2x+1)}{\cancel{2}(2)} = \dfrac{2x+1}{2}</m></li>
    <li><m>\dfrac{9x^2+3}{6x+3} = \dfrac{\cancel{3}(3x^2+1)}{\cancel{3}(2x+1)} = \dfrac{3x^2+1}{2x+1}</m></li></ol></p>
</solution></example>

<warning><p>We cannot cancel the 4's in Example 3a, because 4 is not a factor of the entire numerator.  Thus,
        <me>\dfrac{4x+2}{4} \ne x+2</me>
In Example 3b, we cannot cancel the 3's, because they are terms and not factors.  Thus,
        <me>\dfrac{9x^2+3}{6x+3} \ne \dfrac{9x^2}{6x}</me></p></warning>

<answer><p><ol label="a">
    <li>3 is not a factor of numerator or denominator</li>
    <li>2 is not a factor of the numerator</li></ol></p></answer></exercise>        

<p>We summarize the procedure for reducing algebraic fractions as follows.</p>

<assemblage><title>To reduce an algebraic fraction</title>
    <p><ol label="1">
        <li>Factor the numerator and the denominator.</li>
        <li>Divide the numerator and denominator by any common factors.</li></ol></p>
</assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Reduce each fraction. <ol label="a" cols="2">
        <li><m>\dfrac{3x+12}{6x+24}</m></li>
        <li><m>\dfrac{27x^3-1}{9x^2-1}</m></li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>We firstfactor the numerator and denominator completely.  
        <me>\dfrac{3x+12}{6x+24} = \dfrac{3(x+4)}{2 \cdot 3(x+4)}</me>
    Then we divide numerator and denominator by the common factors 3 and <m>(x+4)</m>. We must cancel the entire expression <m>(x+4)</m> from numerator and denominator (we cannot cancel the <m>x</m>'s or the 4's separately!).
        <me>\dfrac{3(x+4)}{2 \cdot 3(x+4)} = \dfrac{\cancel{3}\cancel{(x+4)}}{2 \cdot \cancel{3}\cancel{(x+4)}}= \dfrac{1}{2}</me>
    All the factors are canceled from the numerator, so we replace them by 1, because any expression divided by itself is 1.</p></li>
    <li><p>The numerator of the fraction is a difference of two cubes, and the denominator is a difference of two squares.  We factor each to obtain
        <me>\dfrac{27x^3-1}{9x^2-1} = \dfrac{(3x-1)(9x^2+3x+1)}{(3x-1)(3x+1)}</me>
        We cancel the factor <m>(3x-1)</m> from top and bottom, to get
        <me>\dfrac{\cancel{(3x-1)}(9x^2+3x+1)}{\cancel{(3x-1)}(3x+1)} = \dfrac{9x^2+3x+1}{3x+1}</me>
    Because we cannot factor any further, we cannot reduce the fraction any further.</p></li></ol></p>
</solution></example>

<exercise><title>QuickCheck 2</title>

    <li>If we want to cancel an expression from a fraction, we must be able to <fillin characters="6"/> it from numerator and denominator.</li>
    <li>When we factor an expression, we write it as a <fillin characters="6"/>.</li>
    <li>If a factor appears in both numerator and denominator, it is called a <fillin characters="6"/> factor.</li>
    <li>If all the factors in the numerator or denominator cancel out, we replace it by <fillin characters="6"/>.</li>

<exercise><title>Practice 4</title>
<statement><p>Reduce each fraction. <ol label="a" cols="2">
        <li><m>\dfrac{x^2-x-6}{x^2-9}</m></li>

        <li><m>\dfrac{x+2}{x+3}</m></li>
        <li><m>2t-1</m></li></ol></p></answer>
</exercise>

<p>Keep in mind that the reduced form is equivalent to the original form of the fraction.  If we evaluate the original form and the reduced form at the same value of the variable, the results are equal.</p>

<example><statement><p>Verify that <m>\dfrac{x^2-x-6}{x^2-9}</m> is equal to <m>\dfrac{x+2}{x+3}</m> for <m>x=2</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We evaluate each fraction at <m>x=\alert{2}</m>.
    <me>\dfrac{x^2-x-6}{x^2-9} = \dfrac{(\alert{2})^2-\alert{2}-6}{(\alert{2})^2-9} = \dfrac{-4}{-5} = \dfrac{4}{5}</me>
and
    <me>\dfrac{x+2}{x+3} = \dfrac{\alert{2}+2}{\alert{2}+3} = \dfrac{4}{5}</me></p></solution></example> 

<exercise><title>Practice 5</title>
<statement><p>If you evaluate <m>\dfrac{3x+12}{6x+24}</m> for <m>x=2</m> and for <m>x=-5</m>, what answer do you expect to get? (Recall Example 4a.)</p></statement>
<answer><m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m></answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>Opposite of a Binomial</title>

<p>Any number (except zero) divided by itself is 1, and any number divided by its opposite is <m>-1</m>.  For example,
        <me>\dfrac{5}{5} = 1 ~~~~~\text{and}~~~~~\dfrac{-5}{5} = -1</me>
The same is true for binomials and other algebraic expressions.  The opposite of an expression can be found by multiplying it by <m>-1</m>.  Thus, the opposite of <m>a-b</m> is
        <me>-(a-b) = -a + b= b-a</me>
and so
        <me>\dfrac{b-a}{a-b} = \dfrac{-\cancel{(a-b)}}{\cancel{(a-b)}} = -1</me>
Here are some examples of opposites.
    <md><mrow> 2a-3b~~~~\amp \text{and}~~~~3b-2a</mrow>
        <mrow> 2a+3b~~~~\amp \text{and}~~~~-2a-3b</mrow>
        <mrow> -x-1~~~~\amp \text{and}~~~~x+1</mrow>
        <mrow> -x+1~~~~\amp \text{and}~~~~x-1</mrow></md>
We can cancel opposites when we reduce fractions.</p>

<example><statement><p>Reduce  <m>~\dfrac{2x-4y}{6y-3x}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We first factor the numerator and denominator.
    <me>\dfrac{2x-4y}{6y-3x} = \dfrac{2(x-2y)}{3(2y-x)}</me>
We see that <m>x-2y</m> is the opposite of <m>2y-x</m>, that is, <m>x-2y = -(2y-x)</m>.  Thus,
    <me>\dfrac{2(x-2y)}{3(2y-x)} = \dfrac{-2\cancel{(2y-x)}}{3\cancel{(2y-x)}} = \dfrac{-2}{3}</me></p></solution>

<subsection><title>Rational Functions</title>

<p>A <term>rational function</term> is a function defined by an algebraic fraction.  That is, it has the form
    <me>f(x) = \dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}</me>
where <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> are polynomials.  A rational function is undefined at any <m>x</m>-values where <m>Q(x) = 0</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-pedal-aircraft"><statement><p>Francine is planning a 60-mile training flight through the desert on her cycle-plane, a pedal-driven aircraft. If there is no wind, she can pedal at an average speed of 15 miles per hour, so she can complete the flight in 4 hours. <ol label="a">
    <li><p>If there is a headwind of <m>x</m> miles per hour, it will take Francine longer to fly 60 miles. Express the time it will take to complete the training flight as a function of <m>x</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Make a table of values for the function.</p></li>
    <li><p>Graph the function and explain what it tells you about the time Francine should allot for the flight.</p></li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>If there is a headwind of <m>x</m> miles per hour, Francine's ground speed will be <m>15 - x</m> miles per hour. Using the fact that time <m>\text{time} = \dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}}</m>, we find that the time needed for the flight will be
            <me>t = f(x) = \frac{60}{15 - x}</me></p></li>
    <li><p>We evaluate the function for several values of <m>x</m>, as shown in the table below.</p>
        <sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
                    <row bottom="minor">
                        <cell><m>x</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>0</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>3</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>5</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>7</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>9</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>10</m></cell></row>
                    <row>
                        <cell><m>t</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>4</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>5</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>6</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>7.5</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>10</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>12</m></cell></row>
            </tabular></sidebyside>
    <p>For example, if the headwind is <m>\alert{5}</m> miles per hour, then
                <me>t=\frac{60}{15-\alert{5}}=\frac{60}{10}=6</me>
    Francine's effective speed is only 10 miles per hour, and it will take her 6 hours to fly the 60 miles. The table shows that as the speed of the headwind increases, the time required for the flight increases also.</p></li>
    <li><p>The graph of the function is shown below. You can use your calculator with the window
                <md>
                    <mrow>\text{Xmin} \amp = -8.5 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 15</mrow>
                    <mrow>\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 30</mrow>
                </md>
    to verify the graph. In particular, the point <m>(0,4)</m> lies on the graph. This point tells us that if there is no wind, Francine can fly 60 miles in 4 hours, as we calculated earlier.</p>
                
    <sidebyside   width="45%"><image source="images/fig-graph-time-against-headwind"><description>graph showing time to complete trip vs speed of headwind</description></image></sidebyside>
            
    <p>The graph is increasing, as indicated by the table of values. In fact, as the speed of the wind gets close to 15 miles per hour, Francine's flying time becomes extremely large. In theory, if the wind speed were exactly 15 miles per hour, Francine would never complete her flight. On the graph, the time becomes infinite at <m>x = 15</m>.</p>
    <p>What about negative values for <m>x</m>? If we interpret a negative headwind as a tailwind, Francine's flying time should decrease for negative <m>x</m>-values. For example, if <m>x = -5</m>, there is a tailwind of 5 miles per hour, so Francine's effective speed is 02  miles per hour, and she can complete the flight in 3 hours. As the tailwind gets stronger (that is, as we move farther to the left in the <m>x</m>-direction), Francine's flying time continues to decrease, and the graph approaches the <m>x</m>-axis.</p></li></ol></p>
</solution></example>

<p>The vertical dashed line at <m>x=15</m> on the graph of <m>t=\dfrac{60}{15-x}</m> is a <term>vertical asymptote</term><idx>vertical asymptote</idx> for the graph. We first encountered asymptotes in <xref ref="basic-functions" text="type-global"/> when we studied the graph of <m>y=\dfrac{1}{x}</m>. Locating the vertical asymptotes of a rational function is an important part of determining the shape of the graph.</p>
