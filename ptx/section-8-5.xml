<p>In <xref ref="example-pedal-aircraft" text="type-global"/>, of Section 8.2, Francine planned a 60-mile training run on her cycle-plane. The time required for the training run, in terms of the windspeed, <m>x</m>, is given by:
    <me>t=f(x) = \dfrac{60}{15-x}</me>
If it takes Francine 9 hours to cover 60 miles, what is the speed of the wind? We can answer this question by reading values from the graph of <m>f</m>, as shown at left. When <m>t = 9</m>, the value of <m>x</m> is between 8 and 9, so the windspeed is between 8 and 9 miles per hour.</p></sidebyside>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Solving Algebraically</title>

<p>If we need a more accurate value for the windspeed, we can solve the equation
    <me>\dfrac{60}{15-x}=9</me>
To start, we multiply each side of the equation by the denominator of the fraction. This will clear the fraction and give us an equivalent equation without fractions.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation  <m>~~\dfrac{60}{15-x}=9</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We multiply both sides of the equation by <m>\alert{15 - x}</m> to obtain
        <md><mrow>\alert{(15 - x)}\frac{60}{15-x}\amp =9\alert{(15 - x)}</mrow>
            <mrow>60 \amp = 9(15 - x)\amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow></md>
From here we can proceed as usual.
        <md><mrow>60 \amp = 135 - 9x\amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract 135 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>-75 \amp = -9x\amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide by }-9.}</mrow>
            <mrow>8.\overline{3} \amp = x</mrow></md>
The windspeed was <m>8.\overline{3}</m>, or <m>8\frac{1}{3}</m> miles per hour.</p></solution></example>

<p>If the equation contains more than one fraction, we can clear all the denominators at once by multiplying both sides by the LCD of the fractions.</p>

<example xml:id="example-clear-fractions"><statement><p>Solve  <m>~~\dfrac{3}{4} = 8- \dfrac{2x+11}{x-5}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is <m>\blert{4(x-5)}</m>. We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD.
    <md><mrow>\blert{4(x-5)}\left(\dfrac{3}{4}\right)  \amp = \left(8- \dfrac{2x+11}{x-5}\right) \cdot \blert{4(x-5)} \amp \amp  \blert{\stackrel{{\Large\text{Apply the}}} {\text{distributive law.}}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\blert{\cancel{4}(x-5)}\left(\dfrac{3}{\cancel{4}}\right)  \amp = \blert{4(x-5)}(8)- \blert{4\cancel{(x-5)}}\left(\dfrac{2x+11}{\cancel{x-5}}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow>3(x-5) \amp = 32(x-5)-4(2x+11)</mrow></md>
We proceed as usual to complete the solution. First we use the distributive law to remove parentheses.
    <md><mrow>3x-15 \amp = 32x-160-8x-44 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Combine like terms.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>3x-15 \amp = 24x-204</mrow>
        <mrow>-21x \amp = -189</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp = 9</mrow></md>
</p></solution></example>

 <warning><p>We must multiply each term of an equation by the LCD, whether or not the term is a fraction. In the previous <xref ref="example-clear-fractions" text="custom" >Example</xref> we multiplied each term by the LCD, including the 8.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Proportions</title>

<p>A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal.  For example,
    <me>\dfrac{7}{5} = \dfrac{x}{6} </me>    
To solve this proportion, we multiply both sides by the LCD, 30, to get
    <md><mrow>\alert{30}\left(\dfrac{7}{5}\right) \amp = \left(\dfrac{x}{6}\right)\alert{30}</mrow>
        <mrow>42 \amp = 5x \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 5.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>x = \dfrac{42}{5} = 8.4</mrow></md></p>

<p>There is a short-cut we can use that avoids calculating an LCD. Observe that we can arrive at the equation <m>42=5x</m> by <em>cross-multiplying</em>:</p>

<p>We then proceed as before to complete the solution.</p>

<example><statement><p>The scale on a map of Fairfield County says that <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> centimeter represents a distance of 10 kilometers.  If Eastlake and Kenwood are 6 centimeters apart on the map, what is the distance between the two towns?</p></statement>

<solution><p>The ratio of the two actual distances is the same as the ratio of the corresponding distances on the map.  We let <m>x</m> stand for the distance between Eastlake and Kenwood, and write a proportion.</p>  
<p>We must be careful to keep the same order in both ratios. We choose to put the distance between towns in the numerators, and the distances on the scale in the denominator.
    <me>\dfrac{\text{distance between towns}}{\text{scale}}:~~~~\dfrac{x}{10} = \dfrac{6}{\dfrac{3}{4}}</me>
To solve the propotion, we cross-multiply.
    <md><mrow>\dfrac{3}{4}x \amp = 10 \cdot 6</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp = \dfrac{60}{\dfrac{3}{4}} = 80</mrow></md>

<subsection><title>Extraneous Solutions</title>

<p>An algebraic fractions is undefined for any values of <m>x</m> that make its denominator equal zero. These values cannot be solutions to equations involving the fraction. Consider the equation
    <me>\dfrac{x}{x-3}=\frac{3}{x-3}+2</me>
When we multiply both sides by the LCD, <m>x - 3</m>, we obtain
    <md><mrow>\alert{(x - 3)}\frac{x}{x-3} \amp =\alert{(x - 3)}\frac{3}{x-3}+\alert{(x - 3)}\cdot 2</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp = 3 + 2x - 6</mrow></md>
whose solution is <m>x = 3</m>. However, <m>x = 3</m> is <em>not</em> a solution of the original equation. Both sides of the equation are undefined at <m>x = 3</m>. If you graph the two functions
    <me>Y_1=\frac{x}{x-3} \hphantom{space}\text{and}\hphantom{space}Y_2=\frac{3}{x-3}+2</me>
you will find that the graphs never intersect, which means that there is no solution to the original equation.</p>

<p>What went wrong with our method of solution? We multiplied both sides of the equation by <m>x - 3</m>, which is zero when <m>x = 3</m>, so we really multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. Multiplying by zero does not produce an equivalent equation, and false solutions may be introduced.</p>

<p> An apparent solution that does not satisfy the original equation is called an <term>extraneous solution</term><idx>extraneous solution</idx>. Whenever we multiply an equation by an expression containing the variable, we should check that the solution obtained does not cause oany of the fractions to be undefined.</p>

<example xml:id="example-clear-fractions2"><statement><p>Solve the equation  <m>~\dfrac{6}{x}+1=\dfrac{1}{x+2}</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We multiply both sides by the LCD, <m>x(x + 2)</m>. Notice that we multiply <em>each term</em> on the left side by the LCD, to get
                <me>\alert{x(x + 2)}\left(\frac{6}{x}+1\right)=\alert{x(x + 2)}\frac{1}{x+2}</me>
    or
                <me>6(x + 2) + x(x + 2) = x</me>
    We use the distributive law to remove the parentheses and write the result in standard form:
                <md><mrow>6x + 12 + x^2 + 2x\amp = x</mrow>
                    <mrow>x^2 + 7x + 12 \amp = 0</mrow></md>
    This is a quadratic equation that we can solve by factoring.
                <me>(x + 3)(x + 4) = 0</me>
    so the solutions are <m>x = -3</m> and <m>x = -4</m>. Neither of these values causes either denominator to equal zero, so they are not extraneous solutions.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>The following "solution" for the previous <xref ref="example-clear-fractions2" text="custom" >Example</xref> is incorrect.  Do you see why?
    <md><mrow>\alert{x(x + 2)}\frac{6}{x}+1 \amp =\alert{x(x + 2)}\frac{1}{x+2}</mrow>
        <mrow>6x+12+1 \amp = x</mrow>

<p>Because Rani paddled for equal amounts of time upstream and downstream, we have the equation
        <me>\frac{30}{12+x}=\frac{18}{12-x}</me>
The LCD for the fractions in this equation is <m>\alert{(12 + x)(12 - x)}</m>. We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain
        <md><mrow>\alert{\cancel{(12 + x)}(12 - x)}\dfrac{30}{\cancel{12+x}} \amp =\dfrac{18}{\cancel{12-x}}\alert{(12 + x)\cancel{(12 - x)}}</mrow>
            <mrow>30 (12 - x) \amp = 18 (12 + x)</mrow></md>
Solving this equation, we find
        <md><mrow>360 - 30x \amp = 216 + 18x</mrow>
            <mrow>144 \amp = 48x</mrow>
            <mrow>3 \amp = x</mrow></md>
The speed of the current is 3 miles per hour.</p></solution></example>

<p>We can solve the equation in <xref ref="example-kayak-current" text="type-global"/> graphically by considering two functions, one for each side of the equation. Graph the two functions
    <me>Y_1=\frac{30}{12+x} \hphantom{space}\text{and}\hphantom{space}Y_2=\frac{30}{12-x}</me>
in the window
    <md><mrow>\text{Xmin} \amp = -9.4 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 9.4</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 10</mrow></md>
to obtain the graph shown below.</p>
        <sidebyside  width="35%"><image source="images/fig-GC-intersecting-rational-functions"/><description>intersecting rational functions</description></sidebyside>
<p>The function <m>Y_1</m> gives the time it takes Rani to paddle 30 miles downstream, and <m>Y_2</m> gives the time it takes her to paddle 18 miles upstream. Both of these times depend on the speed of the current, <m>x</m>.</p> 

<p>We are looking for a value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>Y_1</m> and <m>Y_2</m> equal. This occurs at the intersection point of the two graphs, <m>(3, 2)</m>. Thus, the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, as we found in <xref ref="example-kayak-current" text="type-global"/>. The y-coordinate of the intersection point gives the time Rani paddled on each part of her trip: 2 hours each way.</p>

<subsection><title>Formulas</title>

<p>Algebraic fractions may appear in formulas that relate several variables.  If we want to solve for one variable in terms of the others, we may need to clear the fractions.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve the formula <m>~~p=\dfrac{v}{q+v}~~ </m> for <m>v</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Because the variable we want appears in the denominator, we must first multiply both sides of the equation by that denominator, <m>q+v</m>.
        <md><mrow>\alert{(q+v)}p \amp= \alert{(q+v)}\frac{v}{q+v}</mrow>
            <mrow>(q + v)p \amp = v</mrow></md>
We apply the distributive law on the left side, then collect all terms that involve <m>v</m> on one side of the equation.
        <md><mrow>qp + vp \amp = v \amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract }vp \text{ from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>qp = v - vp</mrow></md>
We cannot combine the two terms containing <m>v</m> because they are not like terms. However, we can factor out <m>v</m>, so that the right side is written as a single term containing the variable <m>v</m>. We can then complete the solution.
        <md><mrow>qp \amp = v(1 - p) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by }  1- p.}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{qp}{1-p} \amp= v</mrow></md>
    </p></solution></example>
