<exercise number="13"><statement><p>Delbert stands at the top of a 300-foot cliff and throws his algebra book directly upward with a velocity of 20 feet per second. The height of his book above the ground <m>t</m> seconds later is given by the equation
    <me>h=-16t^2+20t+300</me>

    <li>Graph the height equation on your calculator. Use your table of values to help you choose appropriate WINDOW settings.</li>
    <li>What is the highest altitude Delbert's book reaches? When does it reach that height? Use the TRACE feature to find approximate answers first. Then use the Table feature to improve your estimate.</li>
    <li>When does Delbert's book pass him on its way down? (Delbert is standing at a height of 300 feet.) Use the intersect command.</li>

<exercise number="16"><statement><p>Irene would like to enclose two adjacent chicken coops of equal size against the henhouse wall. She has 66 feet of chicken wire fencing, and she would like the total area of the two coops to be 360 square feet. What should the dimensions of the chicken coops be?</p>

<p>We'll use three methods to solve this problem:  a table of values, a graph, and an algebraic equation.<ol label="a">
    <li><p>Make a table by hand that shows the areas of coops of various widths, as shown below.

      Continue the table until you find a pair of chicken coops whose area is 360 square feet. (Be careful computing the length of the coops:  look at the diagram above.)</p></li>  
    <li><p>Write an expression for the length of the two coops if their width is <m>x</m>.  Then write an expression for the area  of the coops if their width is <m>x</m>.  Graph the equation for <m>A</m>, and use the graph to find the pair of coops whose area is 360 square feet.  (Is there more than one solution?)</p></li>
    <li><p>Write an equation for the area <m>A</m> of the two coops in terms of their width, <m>x</m>. Solve your equation algebraically for <m>A=360.</m></p></li></ol></p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="17"><statement><p>A length of rain gutter is made from a piece of aluminum 6 feet long and 1 foot wide.</p>
<sidebyside  width="40%"><image source="images/fig-???"><description>picture</description></image></sidebyside>
<p><ol label="a">
    <li>If a strip of width <m>x</m> is turned up along each long edge, write expressions for the length, width and height of the gutter.  Then write an expression for the volume <m>V</m> of the gutter in terms of <m>x</m>.</li> 
    <li>Use your calculator to make a table of values showing the volumes of various rain gutters formed by turning up edges of 0.1 foot, 0.2 foot, and so on.</li>
    <li>Graph your expression for the volume.  What happens to <m>V</m> as <m>x</m> increases?</li>
    <li>Use your table or your graph to discover how much metal should be turned up along each long edge so that the gutter has a capacity of <m>\dfrac{3}{4}</m> cubic foot of rainwater.</li>
    <li>Write and solve a quadratic equation to answer part (d).</li></ol></p></statement>
