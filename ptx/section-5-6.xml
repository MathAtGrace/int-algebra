<title>Functions as Models</title>

<introduction><p>World3 is a computer model developed by a team of researchers at MIT. The model tracks population growth, use of resources, land development, industrial investment, pollution, and many other variables that describe human impact on the planet.</p>
    
<p> The figure below is taken from <em>Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</em>. The graphs represent four possible answers to World3's core question: How may the global population and economy interact with and adapt to Earth's limited carrying capacity (the maximum it can sustain) over the coming decades?</p>

<p>In this chapter, we examine the properties and features of some basic nonlinear functions and how they may be used as mathematical models.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>The Shape of the Graph</title> 

<p>To create a good model we first decide what kind of function to use. What sort of function has the right shape to describe the process we want to model? Should it be increasing or decreasing, or some combination of both? Is the slope constant or is it changing?</p>
<p> In Examples <xref ref="example-home-to-school" text="global"/> and <xref ref="concavity" text="global"/>, we investigate how the shape of a graph illustrates the nature of the process it models.</p>

<example xml:id="example-home-to-school"><statement>
    <p>Forrest leaves his house to go to school. For each of the following situations, sketch a possible graph of Forrest's distance from home as a function of time.<ol label="a">
    <li><p>Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop.</p></li>
    <li><p>Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop; then he waits there until the bus arrives.</p></li>
    <li><p>Forrest walks at a constant speed until he reaches the bus stop, waits there until the bus arrives, and then the bus drives him to school at a constant speed.</p></li>
    </ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>The graph is a straight-line segment, as shown in figure (a). It begins at the origin because at the instant Forrest leaves the house, his distance from home is 0. (In other words, when <m>t = 0, y = 0</m>.) The graph is a straight line because Forrest has a constant speed. The slope of the line is equal to Forrestâ€™s walking speed.</p>
    <sidebyside  width="100%"><image source="images/fig-home-to-school" ><description>distance from home</description></image></sidebyside></li>
    <li><p>The first part of the graph is the same as part (a). But while Forrest waits for the bus, his distance from home remains constant, so the graph at that time is a horizontal line, as shown in figure (b). The line has slope <m>0</m> because while Forrest is waiting for the bus, his speed is <m>0</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>The graph begins like the graph in part (b). The last section of the graph represents the bus ride. It has a constant slope because the bus is moving at a constant speed. Because the bus (probably) moves faster than Forrest walks, the slope of this segment is greater than the slope for the walking section. The graph is shown in figure (c).</p></li>

    </ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>The graph of the data is shown below. The shape of the graph reminds us of the square root function, <m>y = \sqrt{x}</m>.</p><sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/fig-speed-sound" ><description>speed of sound</description></image></sidebyside></li>
    <li>We are looking for a value of <m>k</m> so that the function <m>f(T) = k \sqrt{T}</m> fits the data. We substitute one of the data points into the formula and solve for <m>k</m>. If we choose the point <m>(100, 200.6)</m>, we obtain 
            <me>200.6 = k \sqrt{100}</me>
    and solving for <m>k</m> yields <m>k = 20.06</m>. We can check that the formula <m>s = 20.06 \sqrt{T} </m> is a good fit for the rest of the data points as well. Thus, we suggest the function 
            <me>f (T) = 20.06\sqrt{T}</me>
        as a model for the speed of sound.</li>
    <li><p>First, we use the model to calculate the speed of sound at a temperature of <m>20\degree</m> Celsius. The Kelvin temperature is
            <me>T = 20 + 273 = 293</me>
    so we evaluate <m>s = f (T )</m> for <m>T = 293</m>.
            <me>f (293) = 20.06\sqrt{293}\approx 343.4</me>
    Thus, <m>s</m> is approximately 343.4 meters per second.</p>
    <p>The lightning and the thunderclap occur simultaneously, and the speed of light is so fast (about 30,000,000 meters per second) that we see the lightning flash as it occurs. So if the sound of the thunderclap takes <m>6</m> seconds after the flash to reach us, we can use our calculated speed of sound to find our distance from the storm. 
            <md><mrow>\text{distance} \amp= \text{speed} \times \text{time}</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp = (343.4\text{ m/sec}) (6 \text{ sec}) = 2060.4 \text{ meters}</mrow></md>
    The thunderstorm is 2060 meters, or about 1.3 miles, away.</p></li></ol></p>

<p>At this point, a word of caution is in order. There is more to choosing a model than finding a curve that fits the data. A model based purely on the data is called an <term>empirical model</term><idx>empirical model</idx>. However, many functions have similar shapes over small intervals of their input variables, and there may be several candidates that model the data. Such a model simply describes the general shape of the data set; the parameters of the model do not necessarily correspond to any actual process.</p>

<p>In contrast, <term>mechanistic models</term><idx>mechanistic models</idx> provide insight into the biological, chemical, or physical process that is thought to govern the phenomenon under study. Parameters derived from mechanistic models are quantitative estimates of real system properties. Here is what GraphPad Software has to say about modeling:</p>

<p>"Choosing a model is a scientific decision. You should base your choice on your understanding of chemistry or physiology (or genetics, etc.). The choice should not be based solely on the shape of the graph.</p>

<p>"Some programs . . . automatically fit data to hundreds or thousands of equations and then present you with the equation(s) that fit the data best. Using such a program is appealing because it frees you from the need to choose an equation. The problem is that the program has no understanding of the scientific context of your experiment. The equations that fit the data best are unlikely to correspond to scientifically meaningful models. You will not be able to interpret the best-fit values of the variables, and the results are unlikely to be useful for data analysis."</p>
