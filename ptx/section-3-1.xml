<introduction><p>So far you have learned how to solve linear equations.  In linear equations, the variable cannot have any exponent other than 1, and for this reason such equations are often called <term>first-degree</term>.  Now we'll consider second-degree equations, or <term>quadratic</term> equations. A quadratic equation includes the square of the variable.</p> 

<assemblage><title>Quadratic Equations</title>
<p>A <term>quadratic equation</term> can be written in the standard form 
    <me>ax^2+bx+c=0</me>
where <m>a,~b,~</m> and <m>c</m> are constants, and <m>a</m> is not zero.</p></assemblage>

<p>We would like to be able to solve quadratic equations, use them in applications, and graph quadratic equations in two variables. Let's begin by considering some simple examples.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Graphs of Quadratic Equations</title>

<p>The simplest quadratic equation in two variables is 
    <me>y=x^2</me>
Its graph is not a straight line, but a curve called a <term>parabola</term>, shown in the figure. You can verify the table of values below for this parabola.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>

<p>How can we solve a quadratic equation? Consider the equation
    <me>x^2-4=5</me>
First, we can solve it graphically. Look again at the graph of <m>~y=x^2-4~</m> from Example 1.</p>
    <sidebyside  width="40%"><image source="images/fig-???"><description>graph </description></image></sidebyside>
<p>We would like to find the <m>x</m>-values that make <m>y=5</m>. The horizontal line <m>y=5</m> intersects the graph at two points with <m>y</m>-coordinate 5, and their <m>x</m>-coordinates are the solutions of the equation. Thus, there are two solutions, namely <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m>.</p> 

<p>Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows. <ul>  
    <li><p>First, we isolate the variable.  We add 4 to both sides, yielding <m>~x^2=9</m>.</p></li> 
    <li><p>Because <m>x</m> is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, in order to solve for <m>x</m>. 
        <md><mrow> x^2 \amp = 9  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take square roots of both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow> x \amp = \pm \sqrt{9} = \pm 3 \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Remember that every positive number has two square roots.}}</mrow></md></p></li></ul>
The solutions are <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m>, as we saw on the graph.</p> 

<note><p>Notice that we have found two solutions for this quadratic equation, whereas linear equations have at most one solution. (Sometimes they have no solution at all.) We shall see that every quadratic equation has two solutions.</p></note>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation
    <me>\dfrac{1}{2}x^2-7=8</me>
graphically and algebraically.</p></statement> 

<solution><p>The figure shows the graph of <m>~y=\dfrac{1}{2}x^2-7.</m> </p>
    <sidebyside  width="40%"><image source="images/fig-???"><description>graph </description></image></sidebyside> 
<p>We would like to find the <m>x</m>-values that make <m>y=8</m>. The horizontal line <m>y=8</m> intersects the graph at two points with <m>x</m>-coordinates approximately <m>5.5</m> and <m>-5.5</m>. These are the solution of the equation.</p>         
<p>Algebraically, we solve the equation as follows. <ul>  
    <li><p>First, we isolate the variable.  We add 7 to both sides, then multiply by 2, yielding <m>~x^2=30</m>.</p></li> 
    <li><p>Because <m>x</m> is squared in this equation, we perform the opposite operation, or take square roots, in order to solve for <m>x</m>. 
        <md><mrow> x^2 \amp = 30  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take square roots of both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow> x \amp = \pm \sqrt{30} \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Remember that every positive number has two square roots.}}</mrow></md></p></li>
    <li><p>We use a calculator to find that <m>\sqrt{30}</m> is approximately 5.477, or about 5.5, as we saw on the graph.</p></li></ul></p></solution>
</example>

<warning><p>It is important to make a distinction betweeen exact values and decimal approximations.<ul> 
    <li>For the example above, the exact solutions are <m>\pm \sqrt{30}</m>.</li> 
    <li>The values from the calculator, <m>\pm 5.477</m>, are decimal approximations to the solutions, rounded to thousandths.</li></ul></p></warning>

<p>We can now solve quadratic equations of the form <m>~ax^2+c = 0~</m>, by isolating <m>x</m> on one side of the equation, and then taking the square root of each side. This method for solving quadratic equations is called <term>extraction of roots</term>.</p>

<p>In the next Example, we compare the steps for <em>evaluating a quadratic expression</em> and for <em>solving a quadratic equation</em>.</p>

<example><statement><p>A cat falls off a tree branch 20 feet above the ground. Its height <m>t</m> seconds later is given by <m>h=20-16t^2</m>.<ol label="a">   
    <li>What is the height of the cat 0.5 second later?</li>
    <li>How long does the cat have to get in position to land on its feet before it reaches the ground?</li></ol></p>
</statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>We evaluate the formula for <m>t=0.5</m>. We substitute <m>\alert{0.5}</m> for <m>t</m> into the formula, and simplify. 
        <md><mrow>h \amp= 20-16(\alert{0.5})^2 \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Compute the power.}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 20-16(0.25)  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Multiply, then subtract.}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 20-4=16</mrow></md>
    The cat is 16 feet above the ground after 0.5 second. You can also use your calculator to simplify the expression for <m>h</m> by entering
        <me> 20~~\boxed{-}~~16~~\boxed{\times}~~0.5~~\boxed{x^2}~~\boxed{\text{ENTER}}</me></p></li>
    <li><p>We would like to find the value of <m>t</m> when the cat's height, <m>h</m>, is zero. We substitute <m>h=\alert{0}</m> into the equation to obtain 
        <me> \alert{0} = 20-16t^2</me>      
    To solve this equation we use extraction of roots. We first isolate <m>t^2</m> on one side of the equation.
        <md><mrow>16t^2 \amp =20 \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Divide by 16.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>t^2 \amp = \dfrac{20}{16} = 1.25</mrow></md>
    Next, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find 
        <me>t=\pm \sqrt{1.25} \approx \pm 1.118</me>
    Only the positive solution makes sense here, so the cat has approximately 1.12 seconds to be in position for landing.</p></li></ol></p>

<subsection><title>Geometric Formulas</title>

<p>The formulas for the volume and surface area of some everyday objects, such as cylinders and cones, involve quadratic expressions. We can use extraction of roots to solve problems involving these objects.</p>

<solution><p>The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula  <m>V=\pi r^2h</m>. We substitute <m>\alert{582}</m> for <m>V</m> and <m>\alert{10.5}</m> for <m>h</m>, then solve for <m>r</m>.
    <md><mrow>\alert{582} \amp = \pi r^2(\alert{10.5})  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Divide both sides by}~ 10.5 \pi.}</mrow>
        <mrow>17.643 \amp = r^2 \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take square roots.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>4.2 \amp = r</mrow></md>
 The radius of the can is 4.2 centimeters.</p></solution>

<statement><p>The glass pyramid at the Louvre in Paris has a square base, is 21.64 meters tall, and encloses a volume of 9049.68 cubic meters. Use the formula <m>~V=\dfrac{1}{3}s^2h~</m> to find the length of the base. Round your answer to hundredths.</p></statement>
<solution><p>35.42 m</p></solution>
</exercise>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Solving Formulas</title>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to solve a formula for one variable in terms of the others. You might want to know what radius you need to build cones of various fixed volumes. In that case, it is more efficient to solve the volume formula for <m>r</m> in terms of <m>v</m>.</p>

<example><statement><p>The formula <m>~V=\dfrac{1}{3}\pi r^2h~</m> gives the volume of a cone in terms of its height and radius.  Solve the formula for <m>r</m> in terms of <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Because the variable we want is squared, we use extraction of roots. First, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction.
    <md><mrow>3V \amp = \pi r^2h  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Divide both sides by}~ \pi h.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\dfrac{3V}{\pi h} \amp r^2  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take square roots.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\pm \sqrt{\dfrac{3V}{\pi h}} \amp = r</mrow></md>
Because the radius of a cone must be a positive number, we use only the positive square root: <m>~r = \sqrt{\dfrac{3V}{\pi h}}</m>.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>More Extraction of Roots</title>

<p>We can also use extraction of roots to solve quadratic equations of the form
    <me>a(x-p)^2=q</me>
We start by isolating the squared expression, <m>~(x-p)^2</m>.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~3(x-2)^2=48</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>First, we isolate the perfect square, <m>~(x-2)^2</m>.
    <md><mrow>3(x-2)^2 \amp = 48  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Divide both sides by 3.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>(x-2)^2 \amp = 16  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take the square root of each side.}}</mrow>

<subsection><title>An Application: Compound Interest</title>

<p>Many savings accounts offer interest compounded annually:  at the end of each year the interest earned is added to the principal, and the interest for the next year is computed on this larger sum of money. After <m>n</m> years, the amount of money in the account is given by the formula 
    <me>A=P(1+r)^n</me>
where <m>P</m> is the original principal and <m>r</m> is the interest rate, expressed as a decimal fraction.</p> 

<example><statement><p>Carmella invests $3000 in an account that pays an interest rate <m>r</m> compounded annually.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write an expression for the amount of money in Carmella's account after two years.</li>
    <li>What interest rate would be necessary for Carmella's account to grow to $3500 in two years?</li></ol></p>
</statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>We use the formula <m>A=P(1+r)^n</m> with <m>P=3000</m> and <m>n=2</m>.  Carmella's account balance will be
        <me>A=3000(1+r)^2</me></p></li> 
    <li><p>We substitute <m>\alert{3500}</m> for <m>A</m> in the equation. 
        <me>\alert{3500}=3000(1+r)^2</me>
    This is a quadratic equation in the variable <m>r</m>, which we can solve by extraction of roots. First, we isolate the perfect square.
        <md><mrow>3500 \amp = 3000(1+r)^2  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Divide both sides by 3000.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>1.1\overline{6} \amp = (1+r)^2  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Take square roots.}}</mrow> 
            <mrow> \pm 1.0801 \amp \approx 1+r  \amp \amp \bluetext{\text{Subtract 1 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>r \approx 0.0801 \amp \text{or}~~~~r \approx -2.0801</mrow></md>
    Because the interest rate must be a positive number, we discard the negative solution. Carmella needs an account with interest rate <m>r \approx 0.0801</m>, or over 8%, in order to have an account balance of $3500 in two years.</p></li></ol></p></solution>
</example>  

<p>The formula for compound interest also applies to calculating the effects of inflation. For instance, if there is a steady inflation rate of 4% per year, then in two years the price of an item that costs $100 now will be
        <md><mrow>A \amp = P(1+r)^2</mrow>
            <mrow>100 \amp = (1+0.04)^2 = 108.16</mrow></md></p>

<exercise><title>Practice 6</title>
<statement><p>The average cost of dinner and a movie two years ago was $36. This year the average cost is $38.16. What was the rate of inflation over the past two years?  (Round to two decimal places.)</p></statement>
