<introduction><p>Suppose you drop a small object from a height and let it fall under the influence of gravity.
Does it fall at the same speed throughout its descent? The diagram shows a sequence of photographs of a steel ball falling onto a table. The photographs were taken using a stroboscopic flash at intervals of 0.05 second, and a scale on the left side shows the height of the ball, in feet, at each interval.</p>

<exercise number="1"><statement><p>Complete the table showing the height of the ball at each 0.05-second interval. Measure the height at the bottom of the ball in each image. The first photo was taken at time <m>t=0</m>.</p>

<exercise number="2"><statement><p>Plot the points in the table. Connect the points with a smooth curve to sketch a graph of height versus elapsed time. Is the graph linear?</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="3"><statement><p>Use your graph to estimate the time elapsed when the ball is 3.5 feet high, and when it is 1 foot high.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="4"><statement><p>What was the change in the ball’s height during the first quarter second, from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=0.25</m> ? What was the change in the ball’s height from <m>t=0.25</m> to <m>t=0.50</m> ?</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="5"><statement><p>Add to your graph a line segment connecting the points at <m>t=0</m> and <m>t=0.25</m>, and a second line segment connecting the points at <m>t=0.25</m> and <m>t=0.50</m>. Compute the slope of each line segment.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="6"><statement><p>What do the slopes in part (5) represent in terms of the problem?</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise number="7"><statement><p>Use your answers to part (4) to verify algebraically that the graph is not linear.</p></statement></exercise>
