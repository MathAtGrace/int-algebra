            The Amazon Basin in South America contains over half of the planet's rain forest. The Amazon rain forest is home to the largest collection of plant and animal species in the world, including more than one-third of all living species. During the 1960s, colonists began cutting down the rain forest to clear land for agriculture. The construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway in thee arly 1970s opened large forest areas to development by settlers and commercial interests, increasing the rate of deforestation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Environmentalists are concerned about the loss of biodiversity which will result from destruction of the forest, and about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE, or National Institute of Space Research) uses Landsat satellite photos to monitor the pace of deforestation. According to their data, the original Amazon rain forest biome in Brazil of 4,100,000 square kilometers was reduced to 3,413,000 square kilometers by 2005, representing a loss of 16.8%. The figures for 1987 to 2006 are shown at right, and a plot of the data appears below

    Although the data points do not all lie exactly on a straight line, they are very close. One question we might ask is: If deforestation continues at the same rate, when will the Amazon rain forest disappear completely? In this section we learn to find a linear model that approximates a data set.

    In most cases, a mathematical model is not a perfect description of reality. Many factors can affect empirical data, including measurement error, environmental conditions, and the influence of related variables. Nonetheless, we can often findan equation that approximates the data in a useful way.

                   The graph shown is called a <term>scatterplot</term>. The data are not strictly linear, because the slope is not constant: from 1960 to 1965, the minimum wage increased at an average rate of <m>\dfrac{1.25-1.00}{5}=0.05</m> dollars per year, and from 1970 to 1975, the minimum wage increased at a rate of <m>\dfrac{2.10-1.60}{5}=0.10</m> dollars per year.

                    We would like to draw a line that comes as close as possible to all the data points, even though it may not pass precisely through any of them. In particular, we try to adjust the line so that we have the same number of points above the line and below the line. One possible solution is shown in the figure at right

<p>
    A line that fits the data in a scatterplot is called a <term>regression line</term>. Drawing aregression line by eye is a subjective process. In the Activities Workbook we'll use acalculator to compute a particular regression line called the <term>least-squares regression line</term>, which is widely used in statistics and modeling.
</p>
<p>
    We can still find an equation for a line of best fit using the point-slope formula. We choose two points on the line whose coordinates we can estimate fairly accurately. Note that these two points need not be any of the original data points.

                Because the snack bar cannot sell <m>-8</m> cups of cocoa, this prediction is not useful. (What is the Fahrenheit equivalent of 24°C?)

        </li>
    </ol></p></solution>
</example>

<p>
    Using a regression line to estimate values between known data points is called <term>interpolation</term>. If the data points lie fairly close to the regression line, then interpolation will usually give a fairly accurate estimate. In the Example above, the estimate of 29 or 30 cups of cocoa at <m>9\degree\text{C} </m> seems reasonable in the context of the data.
</p>
<p>
    Making predictions beyond the range of known data is called <term>extrapolation</term>. Extrapolation can often give useful information, but if we try to extrapolate too far beyond our data, we may get unreasonable results. The conditions that produced the data may no longer hold, as in the Example above, or other unexpected conditions may arise to alter the situation.

<subsection><title>Scatterplots</title>

<p>
    The data in a scatterplot may show a linear trend, even though the individual points are not clustered closely around a line. Scattering of data is common in the social sciences, where many variables may influence a particular situation. Nonetheless, by analyzing the data, we may be able to detect a connection between some of the variables.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-cocoa">
    <statement>
        <p>
            The world's population is growing at different rates in different nations. Many factors, including economic and social forces, influence the birthrate. Is there a connection between birth rates and education levels? The figure below shows the birth rate plotted against the female literacy rate in 148 countries.
