<subsection><title>Polar Ice</title>

<p>Three main factors influence the energy balance of the Earth and its temperature:<ul>
        <li><p>The total energy influx from the sun</p></li>
        <li><p>The chemical composition of the atmosphere</p></li>
        <li><p>The ability of the Earth's surface to reflect light, or <term>albedo</term></p></li></ul></p>
<p>Because polar ice reflects light from the sun, the radiation balance over an ice-covered ocean is very different from the balance over an open ocean. The ice component of the climate system, called the <term>cryosphere</term>, plays an important role in the Earth's radiation balance.</p>

<p>Climate models predict that global warming over the next few decades will occur mainly in the polar regions. As polar ice begins to melt, less sunlight is reflected into space, which raises the overall temperature and fuels further melting. This process is called <term>ice albedo feedback</term>. Since satellite monitoring began in 1979, Arctic sea ice cover has decreased about 10% per decade, falling to a startling new low in 2007. </p>

<p>Numerous factors influence the freezing point of sea water, including its salinity, or mineral content. In this Lesson we'll develop a formula for the freezing temperature of water in terms of its salinity.</p>

<p>In earlier sections we learned that:</p>

<assemblage><title>Equation of a Line</title>
    <p><ol label="1">
        <li><p>The <m>y</m>-intercept of a line gives the <term>initial value</term> of <m>y</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <term>slope</term> of the line gives the <term>rate of change</term> of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</p></li></ol></p>
</assemblage>

<p>Comparing these observations with the form for a linear model, we see that
    <md><mrow>\blert{y} \amp =(\blert{\text{starting value}} ) +(\blert{\text{rate}})\cdot x </mrow>
         <mrow>\blert{y} \amp = \hphantom{startin}\blert{b} \hphantom{value}  + ~~ \blert{mx} </mrow></md>
    Usually we write the terms in the opposite order, like this: <m>y = mx + b</m>. We call this last equation the <term>slope-intercept form</term>  for a line. </p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form<idx>slope-intercept form</idx></title>
    <p>We can write the equation of a line in the form
        <md><mrow>y = mx + b</mrow></md>
    where <m>m</m> is the <term>slope</term> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.</p>

<subsection><title>Coordinate Formula for Slope</title>

<p>Slope measures the change in one variable with respect to unit changes in another.To calculate the <term>net change</term> between two points on a number line, we can subtract their coordinates.
    <md><mrow>\blert{\text{net change} = \text{final value} - \text{starting value}}</mrow></md></p>

<p>For example, if you walk from <m>3^{\text{rd}}</m> street to <m>8^{\text{th}}</m> street, your distance, <m>s</m>, from the center of town has increased by 5 blocks, or
    <md><mrow>\Delta s = 8 - 3 = 5 </mrow></md>
 If the temperature <m>T</m> drops from <m>28\degree</m> to <m>22\degree</m>, it has decreased by <m>6\degree</m>, or 
    <md><mrow>\Delta T = 22-28 = -6</mrow></md></p>

<p>The net change is positive if the variable increases, and negative if it decreases.</p>

<sidebyside widths="58% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valigns="middle middle">
    <p>For the graph shown at right, the net change in <m>t</m>-coordinate from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> is
        <md><mrow>\Delta t = 51 - (-23) = 74</mrow></md>
        We can use the notion of net change to write a coordinate formula for computing slope.</p>

<note><p>Notice that the numerator of the slope formula, <m>y_2 - y_1</m>, gives the net change in <m>y</m>, or <m>\Delta y</m>, and the denominator, <m>x_2 - x_1</m>, gives the net change in <m>x</m>, or <m>\Delta x</m>. The coordinate formula is equivalent to our definition of slope, <m>m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Point-Slope Formula</title>

<p>Now consider using the slope formula for a different problem. If we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of any other point on the line.</p>
<p> Instead of <em>evaluating</em> the formula to find <m>m</m>, we <em>substitute</em> the values we know for <m>m</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>. If we then plug in the <m>x</m>-coordinate of any unknown point, we can solve for <m>y</m>.</p>

<p>Remember that the equation for a line is really just a formula that gives the <m>y</m>-coordinate of any point on the line in terms of its <m>x</m>-coordinate. So, if we know the slope of a particular line and one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find its equation.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Graph the line that passes through the point <m>(1,-4)</m> and has  <m>\text{slope}=\dfrac{-3}{4} </m>.</p></li>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><sidebyside widths="55% 40%">
    <p>We first plot the given point, <m>(1,-4)</m>, and then use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is <m>m=\dfrac{-3}{4}=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} </m>, so starting from <m>(1,-4)</m> we move down 3 units and then 4 units to the right. This brings us to the point <m>(5,-7)</m>. We draw the line through these two points. </p>
        <image source="images/fig-point-slope"><description>point slope</description></image></sidebyside></li>
    <li><p>To find an equation for the line, we start with the slope formula,
                    <md><mrow> m=\frac{y_2 -y_1}{x_2 - x_1}</mrow></md>
    We substitute <m>\dfrac{-3}{4} </m> for the slope, <m>m</m>, and <m>(1,-4)</m> for <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>. For the second point, <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, we substitute the variable point <m>(x,y) </m> to obtain

    <p>This is an equation for the line, but if we want to solve for <m>y</m>, we first multiply both sides by <m>x − 1</m>.

</solution></example>

<p>When we use the slope formula to find the equation of a line, we substitute a variable point <m>(x, y)</m> for the second point. This version of the formula,

is called the <term>point-slope form</term><idx>point-slope form</idx> for a linear equation. It is sometimes stated in another version by clearing the fraction to get

<subsection><title>Finding a Linear Model</title>

<p>Now we are ready to find the equation promised in the introduction to this section: a formula for the freezing temperature of water in terms of its salinity.</p>

<p>When we have two data points for a linear model, we can find its equation using two steps: first we compute the slope of the line, then we use the point-slope formula.</p>

<example><statement><p>Sea water does not freeze at exactly 32<m>\degree</m>F because of its salinity.The temperature at which water freezes depends on its dissolved mineral content. A common unit for measuring salinity is parts per thousand, or ppt. For example, salinity of 8 ppt means 8 grams of dissolved salts in each kilogram of water.  Here are some data for the freezing temperature of water.</p>

<subsection><title>Summary</title>

<p>In this section, we studied three different formulas associated with linear equations: the slope-intercept formula, the coordinate formula for slope, and the point-slope formula. How are these formulas related, and how are they different?
</p>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li><p>The <term>slope-intercept form</term>, <m>y = mx + b</m>, is just a special case of the <term>point-slope formula</term>. If the given point <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> happens to be the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0, b)</m>, then the point-slope formula reduces to the familiar form:
        <md><mrow>y\amp =y_1+m(x-x_1) \amp\amp\blert{\text{Substitute } b \text{ for } y_1 \text{ and 0 for } x_1.}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = b + m(x-0) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Simplify.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = mx + b</mrow></md>
    We can use the (shorter) slope-intercept form if we are lucky enough to know the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p> What is the difference between the <term>slope formula</term>
            <md><mrow> m= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow></md>
        and the <term>point-slope formula</term>
            <md><mrow>m= \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} ?</mrow></md>
        They are really the same formula, but they are used for different purposes:<ol label="a">
        <li><p>The slope formula is used to calculate the slope when we know two points. We know <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, and we are looking for <m>m</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The point-slope formula is used to find the equation of a line. We know <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>m</m>, and we are looking for <m>y = mx + b</m>.</p></li></ol></p></li></ol></p>
