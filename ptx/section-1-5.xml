<subsection><title>Polar Ice</title>

<p>
    Three main factors influence the energy balance of the Earth and its temperature:
    <ul>
        <li><p>The total energy influx from the sun</p></li>
        <li><p>The chemical composition of the atmosphere</p></li>
        <li><p>The ability of the Earth's surface to reflect light, or <term>albedo</term></p></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Because polar ice reflects light from the sun, the radiation balance over an ice-covered ocean is very different from the balance over an open ocean. Sea ice also influences deep-ocean circulation, and small changes in ocean currents can have a large effect on coastal and global climate. Thus, the ice component of the climate system, called the <term>cryosphere</term>, plays an important role in the Earth's radiation balance.
</p>
<p>
    General circulation models predict that global warming over the next few decades will occur mainly in the polar regions. As polar ice begins to melt, less sunlight is reflected into space, which raises the overall temperature and fuels further melting. This process is called <term>ice albedo feedback</term>.
</p>
<p>
    Since satellite monitoring began in 1979, Arctic sea ice cover has decreased about 10% per decade, falling to a startling new low in 2007. NASA scientists are working to understand this sudden decline and what it means for climate change. "It really is imperative that we try to understand the interactions between the ice, ocean and atmosphere," according to senior scientist Josefi no Comiso.

<p>
    Numerous factors influence the freezing point of sea water, including its salinity, or mineral content. Unlike tropical oceans, which are temperature-stratified (water near the surface is warmer), the Arctic Ocean is salinity-stratified. In this Lesson we'll develop a formula for the freezing temperature of water in terms of its salinity.

<subsection><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
<p>
    In earlier sections we learned that:
</p>

<assemblage>
    <p><ol label="1">
        <li><p>The <m>y</m>-intercept of a line gives the <term>initial value</term> of <m>y</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <term>slope</term> of the line gives the <term>rate of change</term> of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</p></li>
    </ol></p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    Comparing these observations with the form for a linear model, we see that
    <md>
        <mrow>\blert{y} \amp =(\blert{\text{starting value}} ) +(\blert{\text{rate}})\cdot x </mrow>
         <mrow>\blert{y} \amp = \hphantom{startin}\blert{b} \hphantom{value}  + ~~ \blert{mx} </mrow>
    </md>
    Usually we write the terms in the opposite order, like this: <m>y = mx + b</m>. We call this last equation the <term>slope-intercept form</term>  for a line. 
</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form<idx>slope-intercept form</idx></title>
    <p>
        We can write the equation of a line in the form
        <md><mrow>y = mx + b</mrow></md>
        where <m>m</m> is the <term>slope</term> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.

<subsection><title>Coordinate Formula for Slope</title>

<p>
    Slope measures the change in one variable with respect to unit changes in another.To calculate the <term>net change</term> between two points on a number line, we can subtract their coordinates.
    <md><mrow>\blert{\text{net change} = \text{final value} - \text{starting value}}</mrow></md>
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you walk from <m>3^\text{rd}</m> street to <m>8^\text{th}</m> street, your distance, <m>s</m>, from the center of town has increased by 5 blocks, or
    <md><mrow>\Delta s = 8 - 3 = 5 </mrow></md>
    If the temperature <m>T</m> drops from <m>28\degree</m> to <m>22\degree</m>, it has decreased by <m>6\degree</m>, or 
    <md><mrow>\Delta T = 22-28 = -6</mrow></md>
</p>

<assemblage>
    <p>
        The net change is positive if the variable increases, and negative if it decreases.
    </p>
</assemblage>

<sidebyside widths="58% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valigns="middle middle">
    <p>
        Thus, for the graph shown at right, the net change in <m>t</m>-coordinate from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> is
        <md><mrow>\Delta t = 51 - (-23) = 74</mrow></md>
        We can use the notion of net change to calculate slopes. Recall the coordinate formula for computing slope.

    <solution>
        <p>The denominator of a fraction cannot be zero.</p>

</webwork></exercise>

<p>
    Notice that the numerator of the slope formula, <m>y_2 - y_1</m>, gives the net change in <m>y</m>, and the denominator, <m>x_2 - x_1</m>, gives the net change in <m>x</m>. The coordinate formula is equivalent to our definition of slope, <m>m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} </m>, and is useful for computing slope when we know the coordinates of two points on a line.

<subsection><title>Point-Slope Formula</title>

<p>
    Now consider using the slope formula for a different problem. If we know the slope of a line and the coordinates of one point on the line, we can use the coordinate formula for slope to find the <m>y</m>-coordinate of any other point on the line. Instead of evaluating the formula to find <m>m</m>, we substitute the values we know for <m>m</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>. Then we plug in the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the unknown point and solve for <m>y</m>.

<p>
    There is only one line that passes through a given point and has a given slope. So, if we know the slope of a particular line and one point on the line, we can find its equation. Remember that the equation is really just a formula that gives the <m>y</m>-coordinate of any point on the line in terms of its <m>x</m>-coordinate. To find the equation, we can use the coordinate formula for slope.

<subsection><title>Summary</title>
<p>
    In this section, we studied three different formulas associated with linear equations: the slope-intercept formula, the coordinate formula for slope, and the point-slope formula. How are these formulas related, and how are they different?
</p>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li>
        <p>
            The <term>slope-intercept form</term>, <m>y = mx + b</m>, is just a special case of the <term>point-slope formula</term>. If the given point <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> happens to be the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0, b)</m>, then the point-slope formula reduces to the familiar form:
            <md>
                <mrow>
                    y\amp =y_1+m(x-x_1) \amp\amp\blert{\text{Substitute } b \text{ for } y_1 \text{ and 0 for } x_1.}
                </mrow>
                <mrow>
                    y\amp = b + m(x-0) \amp\amp \blert{\text{Simplify.}}
                </mrow>
                <mrow>
                    y\amp = mx + b
                </mrow>
            </md>
            We can use the (shorter) slope-intercept form if we are lucky enough to know the <m>y</m>-intercept of the line.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            What is the difference between the <term>slope formula</term>
            <md><mrow>
                m= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
            </mrow></md>
            and the <term>point-slope formula</term>
            <md><mrow>
                m= \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} ?
            </mrow></md>
            They are really the same formula, but they are used for different purposes:
            <ol label="a">
                <li><p>
                    The slope formula is used to calculate the slope when we know two points. We know <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, and we are looking for <m>m</m>.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    The point-slope formula is used to find the equation of a line. We know <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>m</m>, and we are looking for <m>y = mx + b</m>.
                </p></li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol></p>
